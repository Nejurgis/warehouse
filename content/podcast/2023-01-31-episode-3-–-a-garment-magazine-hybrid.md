  - body: "In this episode we explore how garments can act as a medium for publishing and function as site for critical questioning. In fashion media, we often interact with fashion through looking at images of garments or reading text about them. This form of interaction can in some ways, attribute in an alienated and disembodied discourse around fashion. So, what happens when we start publishing through textile, through the garment, worn on a body? Can we ‘read’ fashion differently when we interact with the material physically. Together with Anouk Beckers and Ricarda Bigolin we talk about how the intersection between garments, text, and the embodied experience or the performance of wearing narratives, takes shape within their respective practices.   \r\n\n\r\n\nUnzip is hosted by Chinouk Filique de Miranda.\r\n\nMusic:\r\n\nMatt Large - Water Under The Bridge\r\n\nHang Youth - De Modeindustrie Kan De Klere Krijgen"

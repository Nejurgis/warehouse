      Welcome to Unzip - a Warehouse podcast in which we unpack different
      perspectives on fashion. Instead of focusing on fashion as a commercial
      system and on garments as commodities, we'll be exploring alternative
      approaches towards fashion. Think of fashion from an embodied state of
      being, as a political statement and the daily practice of wearing clothes.


      By highlighting the potential of the many forms of fashion that go beyond
      mainstream commercial fashion we question the dominant industry and
      hopefully in the end, decentralize it.


      We're inviting people and practices we admire and want to know more about,
      but also ones we might not fully understand and have a lot of questions
      about.


      So, what can you expect from the first episodes? Together with makers,
      writers, wearers and observers we'll be looking at the role of garments,
      produced, published, seen and worn as a form of protest. We'll be talking
      about non-conforming bodies and how certain communities are creating space
      for themselves. And we'll be exploring textile as a medium for publishing.


      We'll have an in-depth conversation with the Warehouse members about how
      and why warehouse came about, and the journey it has traveled up until
      now.

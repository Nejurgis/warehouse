  - body: "This episode focuses on the commodification of non-conforming communities and how identity politics are drawn out through the diversity trope.\r\n\nWe sit down with Julius Thissen, Pernilla Ellens and Chet Bugter to discuss their activistic and artistic practices, their personal experiences in being part of specific counter cultures and their aim to create space for these communities. \r\n\nWe discuss how the fashion industry has always looked towards subcultural styles and where these subversive looks in fact find their origin. What happens when these looks, garments and specific ways of styling, that are meaningful for these various communities, are presented as timely trends. What are the effects when these are adopted by celebrities?\r\n\nWe question if there is a ‘right’ way for subcultures to seep into ‘mainstream culture’ through wider known or popular socio-cultural events, such as Pride, and talk about the effect and implications for marginalized communities as their visual cues are embraced by a wider audience. \r\n\n\r\n\nUnzip is hosted by Chinouk Filique de Miranda.\r\n\nMusic:\r\n\nMatt Large - Water Under The Bridge\r\n\nHang Youth - De Modeindustrie Kan De Klere Krijgen"

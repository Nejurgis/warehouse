      This episode focuses on fashion as a tool for resistance and the role that
      garments produced, published, seen and worn, have in protesting. 


      We sit down with Andre Chehade Barroux and Hanka van der Voet and dive
      into their fashion practices. We question if forms of protest can ever be
      aesthetic, explore the difference between fashion and garments in protest,
      and how certain communities utilise garments as tool for protest. 


      Unzip is hosted by Chinouk Filique de Miranda.

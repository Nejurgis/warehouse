      This episode focuses on fashion as a tool for resistance - the role
      garments produced, published, seen and worn, have in protesting. We sit
      down with Andre Chehade Barroux & Hanka van der Voet and dive into their
      critical fashion practices, and question if forms of protest can ever be
      aesthetic, the difference between fashion versus garments, and certain
      communities utilise garments as tool for protest. 




      Unzip is hosted by Chinouk Filique de Miranda.

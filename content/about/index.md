  ABOUT


  Warehouse is an Amsterdam-based fashion platform that aims to create an open,
  engaging and inclusive environment that facilitates critical dialogue and the
  creation of a discourse that goes beyond treating fashion as a commodity.
  Warehouse was founded by Elisa van Joolen, Femke de Vries and Hanka van der
  Voet and is run together with Anouk Beckers and Chet Bugter.

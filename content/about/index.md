  ABOUT


  Warehouse is an Amsterdam-based fashion platform that aims to create space for
  explorative, critical and alternative approaches to fashion that move beyond
  industrial commercial fashion and treating garments as commodities. Warehouse
  is a collaborative effort run by Anouk Beckers, Elisa van Joolen, Élise Ory
  and Femke de Vries. We collaborate with Chinouk Filique de Miranda for the
  podcast and Zuzana Kostelanská for the graphic design. 


  Chet Bugter was part of the Warehouse team from 2019 till 2022 and Hanka van
  der Voet from 2018 till 2023.

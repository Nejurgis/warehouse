  ABOUT


  Warehouse is an Amsterdam-based fashion platform that aims to create space for
  expanded fashion practices; those that are research-based, interdisciplinary
  and critically question the commercial fashion industry. Warehouse is a
  collaborative effort. It is currently run by Anouk Beckers, Elisa van Joolen,
  Élise Ory and Femke de Vries. Chinouk Filique de Miranda develops our podcast
  and Zuzana Kostelanská the visual identity and supports all things related to
  graphic design. 


  From 2019 till 2022 Chet Bugter was part of the Warehouse team and, as a
  co-founder, Hanka van der Voet was a member from 2018 till 2023.

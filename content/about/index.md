  ABOUT


  Warehouse is an Amsterdam-based fashion platform that aims to create space for
  explorative, critical and alternative approaches to fashion that move beyond
  industrial commercial fashion and treating garments as commodities. Warehouse
  is a collaborative effort by Anouk Beckers, Chet Bugter (2019-2022), Elisa van
  Joolen, Élise Ory, Hanka van der Voet (2018-2023), Femke de Vries, Chinouk
  Filique de Miranda for the podcast and Zuzana Kostelanská for the graphic
  design.

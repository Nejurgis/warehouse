  ABOUT


  Warehouse is an Amsterdam-based fashion platform that aims to create space for
  explorative, critical and alternative approaches to fashion that move beyond
  industrial commercial fashion and treating garments as commodities. Warehouse
  is run by Anouk Beckers, Elisa van Joolen, Femke de Vries and Hanka van der
  Voet.

      Imagine what a fashion magazine would look like in 400 years. In a world
      with no natural resources left, transformation and recycling are the only
      way forward.


      [_**Our Rags Magazine**_](https://www.instagram.com/ourragsmagazine/) is a
      collaborative project that investigates transformative processes,
      proposing new forms of collective production aimed at the reuse of
      discarded clothing and textiles. The project and resulting magazine
      question consumer behaviour and its relationship to the world in which we
      live. Further expanding the potential of recycled material, _Our Rags
      Magazine_ is a magazine where the pages not only _show_ clothing, but
      actually _are_ clothing.


      The project started in 2019 with a workshop in which children were invited
      to imagine new ways of creating garments and new ways of dressing. The
      workshop revolved around dissecting discarded pieces of clothing brought
      in by the participating children. Subsequently, all garments were cut into
      small pieces and recycled into a new material: paper. A Dutch windmill in
      Loenen (NL) which still masters the age-old technique of transforming old
      rags in cotton-based paper transformed the shredded garments into coarse
      and tactile paper sheets that form the material base of _Our Rags
      Magazine_. Returned to the workshop participants, the kids collectively
      made highly imaginative garments from the rags-to-paper material.


      _Our Rags Magazine_ pushes the possibilities of recycled material even
      further. By manufacturing a fashion publication that is printed on this
      very material – creating a magazine of which the pages don’t merely _show_
      the garments, but _are_ the garments – this project shows the creative
      potential recycling garments and textile can offer.

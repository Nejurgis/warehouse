      The _JOIN Collective Conversation Magazine_ is the result of a _JOIN
      Collective Clothes_ workshop at MA Fashion Strategy. During this workshop
      the students of generation 29 together explored topics such as ownership,
      identity, (intellectual) property, production methods, alienation,
      mystification and value creation and used the _JOIN Collective Clothes_
      manual to make a garment piece. At the end of the workshop the pieces were
      put together, photographed, reflected upon through text and brought
      together in this magazine.


      _JOIN Collective Clothes_ is an initiative by fashion designer Anouk
      Beckers and graphic designer and art director Beau Bertens. Initiator
      Anouk Beckers on _JOIN Collective Clothes_: “What if we open up the
      fashion system and explore it as a non-fixed entity, a system where people
      can playfully join in, where everyone is invited to create fashion
      together?”


      The fashion industry focuses mostly on designer status, brand identity,
      commodities as magical results of invisible processes and an adoration of
      values such as originality and ‘the new’. And although it is often
      perceived as something that is not for everyone, fashion surely is a
      collective practice. By making and wearing clothes together, the design
      and research project _JOIN Collective Clothes_ proposes fashion as a
      collective practice. 


      The base of _JOIN Collective Clothes_ is a modular clothing system that
      consists of four different shapes which can be combined into a full outfit
      (a sleeve, a top, a trouser leg and a part of a skirt). An easy-to-use
      open source manual invites people to get started in designing and making
      the pieces themselves. This manual can be downloaded at
      www.joincollectiveclothes.com. The pieces made by various makers from all
      over the world, subsequently form an ever-growing collection that can be
      seen on the _JOIN Collective Clothes_ website. 


      The project encompasses a series of workshops and designer commissions.
      Everyone is invited to join one of the 4-hour workshops to design and make
      a garment-piece. At the end of the workshop, the results from the
      participants are joined into one complete outfit. The process is playful,
      but at the same time it critically questions the characteristics of the
      fashion system.

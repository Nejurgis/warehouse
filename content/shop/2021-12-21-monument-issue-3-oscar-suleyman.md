      Monument is a fanzine dedicated to the 'Dutch Wave', a group of Dutch
      fashion designers who created international fame around the turn of the
      century. Each number is dedicated to one designer or design duo. This
      second issue focuses on the work of the duo Keupr/van Bentm (Michiel
      Keuper and Francisco van Benthum). Between 1997 and 2001, they challenged
      the fashion industry with their surprising and colorful statement
      collections.


      In Monument, a project by stylist and fashion researcher Mary-Lou Berkulin
      and graphic designer Karen van der Kraats, images and texts from various
      archives are combined with new interviews and photography. Each issue has
      its own unique design and editorial approach, completely in keeping with
      the designer to whom the issue is dedicated. 


      This issue is  dedicated to Oscar Suleyman, the designer duo with a taste
      for anything ‘chic’. The focus is especially on the women that were part
      of the label, both as inspirations and as formative influences. Next to a
      biography and images from the archive, the issue features contemporary
      photography by Woody Bos and Abel Minnée and written contributions by
      Aïcha Abbadi and Tatjana Almuli.

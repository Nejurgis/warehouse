      This edition of A Magazine Reader took place during the Summer Academy of
      Hordaland Kunstsenter in Norway and is created in close collaboration with
      Hordaland Kunstsenter and Pamflett. This issue revolves around the various
      elements that are being used by the fashion media, in this case the Vogue
      UK August 2020, to create fashion. Through analyzing, selecting,
      collecting, cutting, marking, categorizing, assembling and collaging, we
      become aware of the many elements that are used to construct fashion. Like
      in issue three we explore how every possible element; perfume, facial
      creams, rosemary water, travel suggestions, gadgets, books etcetera, is
      used to create stories and myths of a future reality. These 'stories' are
      composed of so much more than garments alone, and in such a way that the
      joints and seams are smoothed out, turning these stories into a reality, a
      truth. During this workshop we disconnect the elements, break the joints,
      cut the seams, unravel body parts and disconnect garments from bodies,
      from backgrounds, objects, animals and gadgets, with the aim to create
      space to critically explore the construct of fashion. 


      A Magazine Reader is an ongoing research trajectory and series of zines
      initiated by Femke de Vries and Hanka van der Voet. It revolves around the
      analysis of a mainstream and high-end fashion magazine and its translation
      into an alternative new zine to provide insight into the cultural power
      and forms of value production that is at the core of fashion media. In it,
      the reader becomes an active actor in the construct of fashion. Re-reading
      the magazine by dissecting it, analysing the words, images, materiality,
      the items shown on the pages and the strategies of the specific magazine
      changes the way we read fashion. 


      In the workshop one specific magazine is selected. This magazine is
      thoroughly read, dissected and critically analysed on elements such as
      models, topicality, advertisements, material, brands, distribution,
      imagery, items, narrative, monetary value, colours, words and order of
      pages. By not starting from the perspective of the fashion system as a
      whole, but from the simple act of reading a fashion magazine, the reader
      gains an active role. Having the material in hands, seeing the images, how
      brands are being represented on the pages, reading the words and tracing
      the page numbers, but also feeling the paper, the weight and being able to
      smell the magazine creates an awareness of the magazine as a material
      object. Something that embodies and communicates the process of value
      production in fashion. A material representation of fashion’s
      ephemerality, dream worlds and fantasies. 


      The readers in the workshop use the material of the original ‘source
      magazine’ to create a new zine that provides insight into the cultural
      power and forms of value production that is at the core of fashion media.
      The existing material is elaborated on by connecting with other material
      (theories, visuals, artistic explorations). As such, A Magazine
      Reader focuses on the reader as an active participant – someone with
      agency rather than a passive consumer – in the process of creating
      fashion. Reading becomes making.

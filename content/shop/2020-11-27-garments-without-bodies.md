      As a part of Bodies Making Meaning, an ongoing research project and
      practice on the position and value of the body in the fashion system, Chet
      Bugter explored the phenomenon of “garments-without-bodies”. These “empty”
      garments appear as ghosts, void of flesh: roaming through the fashion
      magazine, left behind by the rapid trend-cycle of the fashion system,
      looking for bodies that can inhabit them. A zine and accompanying poster
      serve as a first exploration of the method of cutting out the
      garments-without-bodies from the magazine’s pages. The subsequent
      “see-throughs” create juxtapositions of garment, text and body. How can
      these alternative narratives lead to new perspectives upon the fashion
      magazine?

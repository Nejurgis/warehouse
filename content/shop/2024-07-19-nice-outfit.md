      Nice Outfit is an exhibition catalogue and theoretical journal that
      invites a variety of practitioners to respond to the exhibition themes in
      any way they see fit. Issue #2 catalogues the exhibition ‘Knock Knock’
      curated by editor Felix Choong. The exhibition used Peter Galassi’s
      photography exhibition ’Pleasures and Terrors of Domestic Comfort’ held at
      MoMA in 1991 that explored the home as a site of contention as its
      starting point and localised its own exploration through fashion and
      textile. Archival contributions from Comme des Garçons, Vivienne Westwood,
      Issey Miyake and Junya Watanabe were presented alongside graduate
      collections from Rebecca Jeffs and Sheryn Akiki and recent collections
      from VeniceW and Per Götesson among others. 


      Presented alongside show documentation, a set of new writing commissions
      elaborate on the exhibition themes. Philippa Snow explores Andrej
      Zulawski’s Possession and Ari Aster’s Hereditary naturalistic depictions
      of marital conflict in the home and the ensuing hysteria when these are
      pushed to the precipice of no return. Experimental fiction is penned by
      Charlie Fox and Ethan Price. Fox’s from the perspective of a girl’s dress,
      and Price’s where a love and loathing for England motivates a girl’s
      hedonism, delusion and decline in her seaside bedsit. Liara Roux reflects
      on her experiences as a sex worker in the upper echelons of society,
      creating comfort by emulating her client’s mothers. Asa Seresin explores
      the biblical act of cutting up clothes from antiquity into the present day
      rendering pain in three dimensions. The artist Sin Wai Kin provides
      preliminary writing and materials to their art practice whose knack for
      world-building uses speculative fiction to dissolve reality and fantasy.
      Elise By Olsen reflects on the opening of the International Library of
      Fashion Research in Oslo and her relationship with seed donor and
      long-term mentor Steven Mark Klein, alongside scans of designer’s domestic
      spaces and branded interior accessories from the library’s permanent
      collection. Artworks by Julien Ceccaldi, which grace the front and back
      covers are profiled whose vision of the world is one of hyperbole,
      pumped-up or withered down, where every character is at the edge of
      (unrequited) love and utter breakdown. Zach Langley Chi Chi has provided
      excerpts from his diary that revel in the sublime anguish of love and
      lust. Lastly, an interview with auctioneer and vintage fashion, fine
      antique costume and textiles specialist Kerry Taylor discussing the
      emotional history of clothing and estate sales.

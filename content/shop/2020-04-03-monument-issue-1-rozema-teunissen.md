      _Monument_ is a fanzine dedicated to the 'Dutch Wave', a group of Dutch
      fashion designers who created international fame around the turn of the
      century. Each number is dedicated to one designer or design duo. This
      first issue focuses on the work of the duo Rozema/Teunissen (Melanie
      Rozema and Jeroen Teunissen). 


      In _Monument_, a project by stylist and fashion researcher Mary-Lou
      Berkulin and graphic designer Karen van der Kraats, images and texts from
      various archives are combined with new interviews and photography. Each
      issue has its own unique design and editorial approach, completely in
      keeping with the designer to whom the issue is dedicated. A conversation
      between Mary-Lou Berkulin and Rozema/Teunissen has been supplemented with
      quotes and texts from articles from the archive and a new long-read,
      written by fashion researcher Renee van der Hoek. The items from the
      archive have been photographed by Barrie Hullegie.\

      Some words by initiator Mary Lou Berkulin from the introduction of this
      first edition of _Monument_: “Rozema/Teunissen’s designs are part of a
      defining time in Dutch Fashion. With their work, they have paved the way
      for generations. But unfortunately, until today, their heritage is not
      tangible or visible. The majority of their archive is analogue and put
      together before the rise of social media and the internet. The items are
      held in bags, folders, in storage spaces and attics. Some lucky pieces
      have made it into the museum depot where they quietly lie, wrapped in
      acid-free paper, carefully held in climate-controlled spaces. Although
      this is a comfortable situation, it’s the reason they remain far from our
      memory. It’s a place unworthy of their essence”.


      _“Monument_ aims to bring these items back to the surface. By doing so, I
      want to show you that we maybe first need to look back in order to move
      forward into changing today’s fashion system”.\

      \

      “This is not only the story of a young, talented label, bursting with
      ambition and creativity, but also a story about how external factors, both
      local and global, can have an impact on creatives and ultimately change
      their perspectives”.


      “After almost 20 years since they’ve been made, Rozema/Teunissen’s designs
      still embody an exceptionally modern look, and photographer Barrie
      Hullegie beautifully caught this in the three stories we created together
      with items from the archive. In our constant hunger for new fashion we
      have forgotten about the artistry that is fashion design and the amount of
      energy and dedication it takes for a designer to create their work.
      Glossies, social media and the internet are happy to help you long for
      change, by constantly emphasizing on ‘what’s new’. Whilst autonomous
      artists create a body of work during the length of their career, fashion
      designers are expected to reinvent themselves several times per year which
      subsequently, makes their previous work look irrelevant to the public.
      This fascinating side of fashion is the reason why this first edition is
      dedicated to Rozema/Teunissen. They deserve a _Monument_ for creating work
      that goes well beyond fashion’s transitory aspect".\

      **A magazine that can be unfolded and worn as an apron, which again can be
      refolded into a magazine.**


      The research project _Booklook_ fuses the fashion magazine with the
      garment, resulting in a series of wearable fashion magazines. Each issue
      can be unfolded into another type of wearable item and carries stories
      about the role of garments in lives, cultures and practices from various
      artists, designers, writers, thinkers. 


      The fabric-like paper carries stories that stem from the situatedness of
      garments in non-commercial, cultural, and daily realities. _Booklook_
      plays with familiar and important agents in the fashion industry: the
      garment, the fashion magazine, and as the title suggests, the lookbook, a
      publication in which brands traditionally offer buyers an overview of
      their collection (their ‘looks’). _Booklook_ instead aims to address this
      dominant consumerist fashion discourse. Instead of denying and cutting the
      cords with the reality of production, cultural situatedness, historical
      references and practices of use, _Booklook_ opens up these narratives and
      tells exactly these stories.

      The first issue – _Booklook Apron-Delantal_ – shares a text (in both
      English and Spanish) by artist and researcher [María
      Naidich](https://marianaidich.com/) about the Tseltalero dress, a garment
      created and worn by women from both Tseltal and Tojolabal communities in
      the Lacandon jungle, in southeastern Mexico. The Tseltalero dress
      represents an expression of women’s resistance to centuries of control
      over their clothing since the colonial times. It is a garment that is
      produced collectively and strengthens relationships between women,
      allowing them to organize and function autonomously. The Tseltalero dress
      represents the relationships between the community, its environment and
      other human and non-human beings. Based on the Tojolabal understanding
      that endows all beings with a heart, the Tseltalero dress has a hart too,
      suggesting the dress is alive. María’s research on this dress is developed
      in conversation with the Tojolabal community of San Gregorio la Esperanza.
      It explores the complex value of this dress within the Tojolabal and
      Tseltal worldview, sharing some ideas about beauty, garments and the body
      from a non-Eurocentric perspective.

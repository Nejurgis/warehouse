      The Journal of Wear is an anthology interested in the clothes we feel,
      think, play, work, and live in, examining how and why garments are
      incorporated into ordinary life.


      First conceived as a series of digital articles with friend and
      collaborator Esther Koh in 2022, The Journal of Wear features
      narrative-style interviews that capture the wearer’s unique voice and
      story from their perspective with the writer’s.


      By entering one’s wardrobe, an intimate and private space, readers are
      invited into real, lived human experiences of sartorial joy and troubles.
      These stories portray the banality of clothing oneself alongside the awe
      and spectacle that “ordinary” clothing contains and evokes, inviting
      readers to ruminate on the everyday clothing they encounter, seeing them
      as not just tools and objects of self-expression but means of greater
      storytelling.


      In the first printed iteration, The Journal of Wear is introduced by
      Esther Koh and reflected upon by Wonne Scrayen. Nestled in between are
      three visual profiles of Leitu Bonnici, Giulia Coluccello, and Wonne
      Scrayen.

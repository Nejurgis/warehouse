          For Warehouse Wear | The Face Mask Series, we have invited five critical
          fashion practitioners from various corners of the world to share their
          propositions for a - for many of us - new character in our wardrobes: the
          face mask. The participants are FEMAIL (United States), HAiKw/ (Norway),
          Lucia Cuba (Peru), Sho Konishi (Japan) and Schueller de Waal (The
          Netherlands). The Covid-19 circumstances require that many of us start
          wearing face masks in public life from now on. They are becoming an
          integrated part of our daily lives and our appearance in public space.
          Besides that, the face mask is a garment that brings forward mixed
          responses; it reminds us of infectious diseases and danger but it can also
          be seen as an act of solidarity towards others.


          The fourth participant of Warehouse Wear | The Face Mask Series is HAiKw/,
          a Norwegian fashion project created by Harald Lunde Helgensen, Siv Støldal
          and Ida Falck Øien. They designed a mask that also functions as an
          aromatic diffuser for influencing your energy or state of mind. The maker
          and wearer of the mask can use one of the recommended blends in the
          tutorial, or build a mixture of scents themselves.


          The items of the Warehouse Wear Face Mask Series will not be sold, but
          will be released through do-it-yourself video- and .pdf tutorials -
          inviting everyone to start getting acquainted with the face mask and make
          one themselves. You can find the video tutorial over on our
          [IGTV-channel](https://www.instagram.com/amsterdam.warehouse/channel/),
          and the .pdf-tutorial as a free download below.

      _Rework Magazine_ is an initiative of Edwin van Gelder and Johann Tangyong
      in which the format of the fashion magazine is thoroughly explored.
      Focused on the subject of “lying” — lying horizontal, lying upside down,
      lying shot from the bottom, lying together, etc — _Rework_ shows an edited
      and rearranged overview of an extensive archive of fashionable imagery.
      The new context in which these images are presented, as well as the
      removal of any form of typography, highlight _Rework_’s objective: “not to
      present the out­comes of creative processes, but to instead concentrate on
      the print editing process itself.”

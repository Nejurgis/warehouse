          For Warehouse Wear | The Face Mask Series, we have invited five critical
          fashion practitioners from various corners of the world to share their
          propositions for a - for many of us - new character in our wardrobes: the
          face mask. The participants are FEMAIL (United States), HAiKw/ (Norway),
          Lucia Cuba (Peru), Sho Konishi (Japan) and Schueller de Waal (The
          Netherlands). The Covid-19 circumstances require that many of us start
          wearing face masks in public life from now on. They are becoming an
          integrated part of our daily lives and our appearance in public space.
          Besides that, the face mask is a garment that brings forward mixed
          responses; it reminds us of infectious diseases and danger but it can also
          be seen as an act of solidarity towards others.


          The second contribution for Warehouse Wear | The Face Mask Series comes
          from Schueller de Waal: a Dutch fashion label and design studio by Philipp
          Schueller and Rens de Waal. Incorporating a humorous attitude, the
          cucumber-based face mask illustrates their belief in Fashion as Therapy
          and presents the most hydrating option.


          The items of the Warehouse Wear Face Mask Series will not be sold, but
          will be released through do-it-yourself video- and .pdf tutorials -
          inviting everyone to start getting acquainted with the face mask and make
          one themselves. You can find the video tutorial over on our
          [IGTV-channel](https://www.instagram.com/amsterdam.warehouse/channel/),
          and the .pdf-tutorial as a free download below.

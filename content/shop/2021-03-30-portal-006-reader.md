      This reader is a product of the PORTAL 006 classes that took place at
      Comenius Lyceum, a high school in Amsterdam Nieuw-West, in fall 2020.
      Elisa van Joolen initiated this new edition of PORTAL (2017-ongoing) for
      the exhibition ‘Refresh Amsterdam’ at Amsterdam Museum in collaboration
      with de Appel. This edition was made with group 2 students (12–14 years
      old) as part of ‘Kunstklassen’, an arts education programme organised by
      de Appel and Comenius Lyceum.


      The publication shows a trail of connections between personal, economic,
      social, cultural and political values of the garments worn by Comenius
      Lyceum students.

      PORTAL is a research project that explores the economic, social and
      emotional value of clothing and offers a ‘way in’ to understanding
      garments from a multitude of overlapping and intersecting perspectives.


      For every edition, participants are asked to take off a garment, lay it
      down on a large Tyvek sheet, outline their garment with tape and answer a
      series of questions regarding its production (Where was it made?),
      materials (What is it made of?), ownership (Is it yours?) and value (How
      much did it cost? What is the emotional value?). Subsequently connections
      are made between the garments by literally drawing lines between the items
      of the various visitors, creating a network that reveals connections
      between and intersections of personal, economic, social, cultural and
      political realms surfacing a complex and layered system of the reality of
      clothing. This culminates in a map, or landscape of personal stories that
      connect to form a fashion network which inverts our gaze, shining a
      spotlight on the intricacies of our own outfits and extraordinary aspects
      of the everyday as opposed to the myth of the exclusive fashion image.
      PORTAL thus provides an entryway to a vision that begins to prioritise
      values that are ephemeral and yet integral in “influencing hearts and
      minds and shaping the way we live together”. It captures and visualises
      information that circumvents established hierarchies and disrupts the
      homogeneity of the commercially driven fashion system with the refreshing
      diversity of fashion that is worn; embodied and imperfect.


      The collected information of each PORTAL edition is visualized and brought
      together in a reader using the sixteen PORTAL questions as their starting
      point.

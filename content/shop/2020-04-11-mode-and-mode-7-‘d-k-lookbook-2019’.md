      _Mode and Mode_ is a periodical that addresses printed matter in fashion
      practice by Laura Gardner and Karina Soraya. Continuing the mission of
      _Mode and Mode_ in exploring experimental publishing practices at the
      margins of fashion, this issue shares a body of experimental text works by
      the critical fashion practice of D&K. Accompanying the D&K _Look Book 2019
      - All or Nothing, Mode and Mode 7_ serves as an anthology of text works
      and biographical listings of key D&K projects from 2012 to present. 


      As intrinsic to their exhibition and garment-based work, D&K produce
      writing—including ficto-critical prose, cut-and-paste collage, poetry, and
      screenwriting—to reconstitute components of fashion, such as the garment,
      atmospheric conditions of retail space and packaging ephemera. Their
      interrogation of fashion language in (and as) branding highlights the
      plasticity of words, which are always both meaningless and meaningful.


      _Mode and Mode 7_ was co-launched with the _D&K LOOK BOOK 2019_ at San
      Serriffe. Warehouse is happy to have hosted the Dutch launch of both
      publications.

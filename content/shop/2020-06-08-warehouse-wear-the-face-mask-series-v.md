      For Warehouse Wear | The Face Mask Series, we have invited five critical
      fashion practitioners from various corners of the world to share their
      propositions for a - for many of us - new character in our wardrobes: the
      face mask. The participants are FEMAIL (United States), HAiKw/ (Norway),
      Lucia Cuba (Peru), Sho Konishi (Japan) and Schueller de Waal (The
      Netherlands). The Covid-19 circumstances require that many of us start
      wearing face masks in public life from now on. They are becoming an
      integrated part of our daily lives and our appearance in public space.
      Besides that, the face mask is a garment that brings forward mixed
      responses; it reminds us of infectious diseases and danger but it can also
      be seen as an act of solidarity towards others.


      In the last installment of Warehouse Wear | The Face Mask Series, Peruvian
      designer Lucia Cuba addresses a group that might have a lot of difficulty
      understanding why everyone is suddenly wearing a face mask — children.
      Using her tutorial, parent and child can work together and create a mask
      for the child’s favourite toy; making sense of the world in a pandemic by
      playing and making together.


      The items of the Warehouse Wear Face Mask Series will not be sold, but
      will be released through do-it-yourself video- and .pdf tutorials -
      inviting everyone to start getting acquainted with the face mask and make
      one themselves. You can find the video tutorial over on our
      [IGTV-channel](https://www.instagram.com/amsterdam.warehouse/channel/),
      and the .pdf-tutorial as a free download below.

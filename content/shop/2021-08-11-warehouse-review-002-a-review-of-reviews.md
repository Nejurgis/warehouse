      Review of Reviews'.


      With the _Warehouse Review_ series, we aim to give a proper analysis and
      contextualisation of certain contemporary fashion phenomena, but not only
      through an essayistic approach. Instead, we deploy various methods of
      research and analysis to zoom in on specific aspects that make – in our
      estimation – a fashion phenomenon into what it is. Our first edition of
      _Warehouse Review_, entitled ‘People Wearing Off-White’, was a thorough
      study of the fashion label Off-White and its immense popularity. With this
      second edition of _Warehouse Review_, we are taking a more meta approach:
      we are reviewing the fashion review, and in specific, those of the Louis
      Vuitton fall 2020 womenswear collection. 


      In his fall 2020 collection, Nicolas Ghesquière, the creative director of
      Louis Vuitton womenswear, explored notions around time. Talking to Nicole
      Phelps, the Director of Vogue Runway, he stated: “I wanted to imagine what
      could happen if the past could look at us.” With that sentiment in mind,
      the contributors of this _Warehouse Review_ interrogated these, now
      historical written records, that collectively make up a response to Louis
      Vuitton fall 2020 presentation. Through this meta-critique, we hope to
      explore what we might learn about these past examples of catwalk writing
      as a way to move the discipline forward. As McNeil and Miller declared
      “…the reviewer is the critic!” it is now time to critique the critic and
      to review the review.

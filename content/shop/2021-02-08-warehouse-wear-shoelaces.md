      Warehouse Wear shoelaces featuring a retelling of the shoelace's being:


      I am consisting of two tail ends. I am crossed like an X – pulled on –
      knotted – now I have a bunny ear – I am wrapped around – looped – pulled
      through an opening – tightened. Now I am connected – I interweave – zigzag
      – entwine – fasten – I loop – fuse – assemble – close – I bound – secure 
      – and keep things together.

      The FAT BELLY BOY BOOKLET is a first in a series of zine explorations of
      Chet Bugter's project _selfies as self love praxis_. 


      "(...) the act of taking and uploading the selfie becomes a moment to
      focus on my own perception of my body, and how this body relates to its
      surroundings. Uploading a picture of one’s body can become quite radical
      when said body is “different” in comparison to normative, and subsequently
      fashionable bodies. Every time I post my body — often unclothed, with its
      stretchmarks, skinfolds, hair, sweat, large belly and chest,
      discolorations — onto a digital platform, it breaks the endless stream of
      perfectly stylized bodies that inhabit Instagram."

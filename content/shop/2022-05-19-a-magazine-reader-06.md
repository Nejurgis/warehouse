      This edition of _A Magazine Reader_, that took place at MA Critical
      Fashion Practices at ArtEZ University of the Arts in collaboration with
      [**Chet Bugter**](https://chetjulius.com/ABOUT) and graphic designer
      [**Zuzana Kostelanská**](https://studiozuzana.xyz), revolves around the
      idea of the ‘culture of emotions’, self-help, therapy and
      self-transformation within the construct of fashion. Besides our
      constantly changing looks, that are expressions of fluid identities, our
      minds and ‘inner selves’ are also ever changing and the idea of
      transformation is pushed beyond changing clothes or moving between
      traditional forms of status in society. Being responsible for our own
      emotional state of mind as something that should be transformed to a
      higher sense of being, todays fashion is strongly focussed on self-care,
      therapy and self-transformation and has connected this to symbols, object
      and situations. The fashion magazine is one of the cultural formats in
      which this societal focus becomes clearly visible and commodified.

      _A Magazine Reader_ is an ongoing research trajectory and series of zines
      initiated by [**Femke de Vries**](https://www.femkedevries.com/) and
      [**Hanka van der Voet**](https://pressandfoldmagazine.com/). It revolves
      around the analysis of a mainstream and high-end fashion magazine and its
      translation into an alternative new zine to provide insight into the
      cultural power and forms of value production that is at the core of
      fashion media. In it, the reader becomes an active actor in the construct
      of fashion. Re-reading the magazine by dissecting it, analysing the words,
      images, materiality, the items shown on the pages and the strategies of
      the specific magazine changes the way we read fashion.


      In the workshop one specific magazine is selected. This magazine is
      thoroughly read, dissected and critically analysed on elements such as
      models, topicality, advertisements, material, brands, distribution,
      imagery, items, narrative, monetary value, colours, words and order of
      pages. By not starting from the perspective of the fashion system as a
      whole, but from the simple act of reading a fashion magazine, the reader
      gains an active role. Having the material in hands, seeing the images, how
      brands are being represented on the pages, reading the words and tracing
      the page numbers, but also feeling the paper, the weight and being able to
      smell the magazine creates an awareness of the magazine as a material
      object. Something that embodies and communicates the process of value
      production in fashion. A material representation of fashion’s
      ephemerality, dream worlds and fantasies.

       The readers in the workshop use the material of the original ‘source magazine’ to create a new zine that provides insight into the cultural power and forms of value production that is at the core of fashion media. The existing material is elaborated on by connecting with other material (theories, visuals, artistic explorations). As such, A Magazine Reader focuses on the reader as an active participant – someone with agency rather than a passive consumer – in the process of creating fashion. Reading becomes making.

      This second issue of Booklook can be unfolded and worn as a shirt, which
      again can be refolded into a magazine. 


      **This publication is sold via this webshop without any crochet attached
      to it.** 


      Booklook is a research project by Anouk Beckers that fuses the fashion
      magazine with the garment, resulting in a series of wearable fashion
      magazines. Each issue can be unfolded into another type of wearable item
      and carries stories about the role of garments in lives, cultures and
      practices from various artists, designers, writers, thinkers.


      The fabric-like paper carries stories that stem from the situatedness of
      garments in non-commercial, cultural, and daily realities. Booklook plays
      with familiar and important agents in the fashion industry: the garment,
      the fashion magazine, and as the title suggests, the lookbook, a
      publication in which brands traditionally offer buyers an overview of
      their collection (their ‘looks’). Booklook instead aims to address this
      dominant consumerist fashion discourse. Instead of denying and cutting the
      cords with the reality of production, cultural situatedness, historical
      references and practices of use, Booklook opens up these narratives and
      tells exactly these stories.

      Booklook Shirt carries the essay _Fragments of DIY stories_, about
      do-it-yourself practices in fashion, by researcher Alessandra Varisco.


      DIY activities in fashion include various types of craft techniques such
      as knitting, embroidery, pattern making, sewing, quilting, etc. Often
      considered as a frivolous practice, DIY fashion is rarely researched.
      However, in this text, the subject is explored from several perspectives
      which are divided in a set of short chapters that fit the fluidity of the
      shape of the hybrid garment-magazine. In one chapter, Alessandra compares
      DIY to purchasing clothes and explores DIY as a practice of privilege.
      Another chapter showcases DIY activities from an historical perspective
      and its function in defining women’s role and garment workers’ rights. DIY
      periodicals for sewing, knitting and pattern making and their effect on
      consumption behaviour as well as the relationship between home dressmaking
      and garment industrial production are explored. It also shares some
      specific cases where home dressmaking and DIY practices were seen as
      illegal tools to subvert predominant narratives and generate change. To
      give an overview of all these perspectives, the issue includes a glossary
      about DIY fashion.

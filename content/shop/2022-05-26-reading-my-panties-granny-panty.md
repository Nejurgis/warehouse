      **__**[**_Reading My
      Panties_**](https://www.lulinl.com/reading-my-panties/) is a collective
      zine initiated by [**Lu Lin**](https://www.lulinl.com/) for the
      underrepresented discussions on panties, drawing on theories of
      intersectionality and feminism. Panties, understood as an item of women’s
      undergarment for the lower body, record our daily usage and bodily
      maintenance. It’s like a locked diary that we use frequently but barely
      scrutinise and discuss.


      Beside the zine, Lu also produced a small series of silk-screened granny
      panties, with a quote from the zine on the back.

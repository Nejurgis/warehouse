      In _A Magazine Reader Invites 01_, Zuzana Kostelanská folds a complete
      fashion magazine into a new zine. The fold shifts our perspective, cuts
      pages in half and re-arranges the order of the pages changing our way of
      reading. In _A Magazine Reader Invites_ an artist/thinker/designer is
      invited to re-read a fashion magazine. Every edition includes a
      conversation with the maker about the approach of re-reading the magazine.


      _A Magazine Reader Invites_ is part of the _A Magazine Reader_ series
      which revolves around the analysis of a mainstream and high-end fashion
      magazine and its translation into an alternative new zine to provide
      insight into the cultural power and forms of value production that is at
      the core of fashion media. In it, the reader becomes an active actor in
      the construct of fashion. Re-reading the magazine by dissecting it,
      analysing the words, images, materiality, the items shown on the pages and
      the strategies of the specific magazine changes the way we read fashion.


      _A Magazine Reader Invites_ is initiated by Hanka van der Voet and Femke
      de Vries. \

  - body: "Paratextile Magazine, issue 01, “on making clothes”\n\nParatextile Magazine, made by Alessandra Varisco, is an experimental alternative sewing and pattern-making publication that aims to collect and create space for knowledge, heritage, relationships, stories, and ways of making clothes from various fashion systems. \r\n\n\rThe magazine is a re-interpretation of contemporary and past DIY-periodicals with instructions for sewing, knitting, pattern cutting, etc. Instead of sharing instructions for making clothes as a leisure activity, Paratextile Magazine opens up the practice of dressmaking to free interpretation, to share self-taught experimental approaches and stories on hidden processes of garments production. \r\n\nThis magazine includes a pull-out pattern to recreate an intuitive t-shirt"

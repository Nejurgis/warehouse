      Paratextile Magazine, issue 01, “on making clothes”


      Paratextile Magazine is an experimental project. It is an alternative
      sewing and pattern making publication addressing the gap between
      consumption and production in fashion, and in particular in fashion media.
      The publication aims to fill in this gap providing text and do-it-yourself
      instructions to practice and read about clothes production. The project
      aims to create a space where knowledge, heritage, relationships, stories
      and manners of making clothes can be narrated, both from the fashion
      industry and from other fashion systems. The magazine is a
      re-interpretation of contemporary and past DIY periodicals with
      instructions for sewing, knitting, pattern cutting, etc. Instead of just
      sharing instructions for making clothes as a leisure activity, Paratextile
      Magazine opens up the practice of dressmaking to free interpretation, to
      share self-taught experimental approaches. 


      This magazine includes a pull-out pattern to recreate an intuitive t-shirt

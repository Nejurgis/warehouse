      [_**Reading My Panties**_](https://www.lulinl.com/reading-my-panties/) is
      a collective zine initiated by [**Lu Lin**](https://www.lulinl.com/) for
      the underrepresented discussions on panties, drawing on theories of
      intersectionality and feminism. Panties, understood as an item of women’s
      undergarment for the lower body, record our daily usage and bodily
      maintenance. It’s like a locked diary that we use frequently but barely
      scrutinise and discuss. 


      The first issue of the zine, _A Collective Manifesto_, includes ten
      women's stories of scrutinising panties, exposing how social
      constructs—self-objectification, gender regulations, conventional
      chastity, taboos, slut-shaming, body-shaming, etc.— hinder women’s sense
      of safety and feeling at home in their bodies.

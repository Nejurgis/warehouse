      _Press & Fold | Notes on making and doing fashion_ is an independent
      fashion magazine that aims to explore alternative fashion forms and
      narratives. The magazine provides a platform for critical fashion
      practitioners who actively seek out the cracks and fissures in the current
      fashion system to propose new opportunities for making and doing fashion.


      With this _Press & Fold_ issue on Resistance, we show a series of
      critiques of and propositions on resistance. Many fashion houses and
      labels have been incorporating concepts of ‘protest’ and ‘resistance’ in
      their clothing and collections over the years: from the protest T-shirts
      created by Vivienne Westwood and Katharine Hamnett in the 1970s and 1980s
      to the Chanel Spring/Summer 2015 show, featuring ‘traditional’ models
      (skinny and mainly white) carrying protest signs emblazoned with texts
      such as “Ladies First”, “Women’s Rights Are More Than Alright”, and
      “History Is Her Story” while wearing thousand-euro outfits, and the Dior
      Fall/Winter 2018 show which attempted to channel the resistance culture
      amongst students of the 1960s to advocate for women's equality. However,
      considering fashion’s entanglement with capitalism, we must wonder: how
      seriously should we take these statements? Rather than a genuine attempt
      at protest and resistance, the examples mentioned present a palatable and
      aestheticised version of the action, which allows the consumer to buy into
      a narrative of activism, rather than actually doing something concrete. 


      People have been adapting their clothing styles to show signs of protest
      and resistance for many years without having to buy (into) the fashion
      industry’s notion of it. From the suffragettes’ white dresses in the early
      1900s and the Indian Khadi movement in the 1920s to the black berets of
      the Black Panthers in the 1960s, from the pink pussy hats of the 2017
      Women’s March and #metoo movement to the green bandana of the pro-choice
      movement in Argentina in 2018, and the COVID facemasks with “I Can’t
      Breathe” written on them of the 2020 BLM protests: clothing has enabled
      wearers to show their political affiliations and solidarity with people
      and movements through visual signs and sign systems. But often, co-option
      by the fashion industry looms. Missoni created an expensive version of the
      pink pussy hat for their Fall/Winter 2017 collection, and the Black
      Panthers black beret appeared on Dior’s catwalk that same season. 


      This _Press & Fold_ issue on Resistance presents conversations,
      propositions and imaginations of fashion and resistance outside of
      fashion’s industrial context. For protest and resistance to become
      effective, it depends on community to generate, support and further it:
      with this issue we think further on these ideas of protest, activism and
      resistance in and around fashion, and not only in terms of clothing, and
      how it is portrayed in (fashion) imagery, but also in terms of how fashion
      is structured and organised: is fashion only able to thrive within a
      capitalist structure, or are there other possibilities as well? What
      ideas, initiatives and structures can be developed for fashion to become
      inclusive and generous to all participants? What needs to be resisted and
      what needs to be embraced? In that sense this issue of _Press & Fold_, as
      well as the previous issues, is a world-building exercise, and wants to
      show what we can do without, and what we need to move fashion towards
      becoming a generous to all participants involved?

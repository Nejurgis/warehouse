  - body: "Calendar 2025: Pulled Thread takes its name from the eponymously titled process in which fabric threads are pulled tightly to form distinct designs.\r\n\n\rFeaturing various pulled fabric stitches such as the four-sided stitch and diagonal cross filling stitch, the calendar utilizes the technique of pulling threads in regular stitch counts and orientation in order to create negative spaces that give a lacey appearance to the fabric.\r\n\n\rThe typography used for the calendar is based on lettering typically featured in classical cross stitch embroidery. Stitched entirely in French knot, the typography features a raised texture which stands in contrast to the stitching of the calendar’s border.\r\n\n\rThe embroidery has been photographed and printed in black and grey duotone to a 1:1 scale. Each calendar is hand numbered and comes pre-folded in an envelope.\r\n\n\rCalendar 2025: Pulled Thread can be used as a decorative item or as a functional calendar. If you wish to use it as a calendar, carefully separate the sheets along the perforated lines by hand."

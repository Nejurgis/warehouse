      This Portal 005 Reader is the result of the PORTAL 005 workshop that took
      place during the exhibition _Don’t Feed the Monster!_ at Galleri F 15,
      Moss Norway. During this workshop, initiated by Elisa van Joolen, the
      economic, social and emotional value of clothing worn by visitors of the
      exhibition was collected and researched. This reader brings together the
      resulting data from the workshop along with the data from PORTAL 001, 002
      and 004, connecting the answers and insights of a total of 362
      participants.  


      _PORTAL_ is a research project that explores the economic, social and
      emotional value of clothing and offers a ‘way in’ to understanding
      garments from a multitude of overlapping and intersecting perspectives. 


      For every edition, participants are asked to take off a garment, lay it
      down on a large Tyvek sheet, outline their garment with tape and answer a
      series of questions regarding its production (Where was it made?),
      materials (What is it made of?), ownership (Is it yours?) and value (How
      much did it cost? What is the emotional value?). Subsequently connections
      are made between the garments by literally drawing lines between the items
      of the various visitors, creating a network that reveals connections
      between and intersections of personal, economic, social, cultural and
      political realms surfacing a complex and layered system of the reality of
      clothing. This culminates in a map, or landscape of personal stories that
      connect to form a fashion network which inverts our gaze, shining a
      spotlight on the intricacies of our own outfits and extraordinary aspects
      of the everyday as opposed to the myth of the exclusive fashion image.
      _PORTAL_ thus provides an entryway to a vision that begins to prioritise
      values that are ephemeral and yet integral in “influencing hearts and
      minds and shaping the way we live together”. It captures and visualises
      information that circumvents established hierarchies and disrupts the
      homogeneity of the commercially driven fashion system with the refreshing
      diversity of fashion that is worn; embodied and imperfect. 


      The collected information of each _PORTAL_ edition is visualized and
      brought together in a reader using the sixteen _PORTAL_ questions as their
      starting point.

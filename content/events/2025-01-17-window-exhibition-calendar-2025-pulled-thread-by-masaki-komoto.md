      The calendar 2025: Pulled Thread by Masaki Komoti is on display in our
      shop window from 17 - 31 January 2025. 


      Calendar 2025: Pulled Thread takes its name from the eponymously titled
      process in which fabric threads are pulled tightly to form distinct
      designs. In the window exhibition you can find the orginal copy of the
      hand embroidered object that Masaki made as a blue print for the printed
      calendar. 


      The printed calendar is still available in [our
      webshop](https://www.thisiswarehouse.com/shop/2024-11-19-calendar-2025-pulled-thread)
      and store on Sint Jansstraat 51, Amsterdam

      Featuring various pulled fabric stitches such as the four-sided stitch and
      diagonal cross filling stitch, the calendar utilizes the technique of
      pulling threads in regular stitch counts and orientation in order to
      create negative spaces that give a lacey appearance to the fabric.


      The typography used for the calendar is based on lettering typically
      featured in classical cross stitch embroidery. Stitched entirely in French
      knot, the typography features a raised texture which stands in contrast to
      the stitching of the calendar’s border.

      To share the calendar as a printed object, the embroidery has been
      photographed and printed in black and grey duotone to a 1:1 scale. Each
      calendar is hand numbered and comes pre-folded in an envelope. 


      Calendar 2025: Pulled Thread can be used as a decorative item or as a
      functional calendar. If you wish to use it as a calendar, carefully
      separate the sheets along the perforated lines by hand.

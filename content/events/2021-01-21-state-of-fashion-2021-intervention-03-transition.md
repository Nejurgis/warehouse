      State of Fashion invited us to guest-edit the third installment in their
      intervention series. Following the stages of introspection and origins,
      our contribution will focus on transition. In our programme, we will
      explore what agency fashion practitioners have to provide alternative,
      non-capitalist, non-industrial modes and frameworks for making, doing,
      seeing and experiencing fashion.


      As today’s fashion industry and capitalism are inseparably intertwined, it
      is important to depart from a distinction between the fashion industry and
      other forms of fashion when exploring alternative approaches. The fashion
      industry or industrial fashion is, we believe, just one of the many forms
      of fashion under the umbrella of a ‘fashion system’. However, it is this
      capitalist form of fashion, which is one of exploitation, colonisation and
      pollution, that is by far the most dominant and damaging one. In regard to
      the theme of “transition”, we strongly believe that we can’t fix this
      toxic fashion system with the same capitalist culture that has created it.
      Therefore, we decided to focus on and connect with several critical
      (fashion) practitioners who in their practice address and criticize the
      limits and enclosures of a capitalist fashion industry, but also show us
      ways and tools to opt out and create an alternative approach to fashion.


      To kick of our guest-editorship, we would like to present a longread in
      parts, which we wrote together with 3 co-authors: [Chinouk Filique de
      Miranda](https://www.chinoukfilique.info/), [Aïcha
      Abbadi](http://www.aichaabbadi.com/) and [Shanzai
      Lyric](https://shanzhailyric.info/). First up is the Warehouse
      contribution: ‘Fashion Against Capitalism’. You can find the longread
      [_here_](https://thisisanintervention.org/en/intervention-03-transition-an-introduction/longread-03-part-1-warehouse/).

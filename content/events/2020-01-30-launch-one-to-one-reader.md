      A conversation with Elisa van Joolen and Matthias Kreutzer (Our Polite
      Society).


      Elisa van Joolen’s new publication *One-to-One Reader* refers to her
      working method in which items of clothing became large-sized printing
      tools, covered in black and blue ink. Each clothing item served as a
      stamp, and was simultaneously being stamped on, thus creating a chain
      reaction and making each clothing item an original and a copy. As such the
      project *One-to-One* offers new perspectives on reproduction – it allows
      us to look beyond the status conveyed by the label and see the actual,
      material properties of clothing.


      Bringing together contributions by Amelia Groom, Ruby Hoette, Joke
      Robaard, T’ai Smith and Hanka van der Voet this reader explores some of
      the project’s core questions: What does it mean to copy in fashion? What
      if a garment could be both a copy and an original at the same time? What
      if reproduction and production are one and the same? This reader, designed
      by Our Polite Society and published by Onomatopee, documents the process
      and outcomes of the *One-to-One* project as well as exploring the
      implications and possibilities of this unique working method in the
      broader context of the fashion system.

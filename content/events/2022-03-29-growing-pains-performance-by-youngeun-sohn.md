      Billboards lit from the inside brighten up the city. On its surface, a
      roll of several posters keeps rotating to catch the eyes of passer-by’s
      with its advertisements of services and products. From 15 – 21 February
      2022, artist Youngeun Sohn will take over one of the billboards in the
      centre of Amsterdam. The advertisement device at the intersection of the
      Amstelstraat and the Blauwbrug, will showcase images generated through her
      project CCTV Catwalk (a.k.a. Growing Pains). For one week, day and night
      Youngeun will be part of the cityscape – presenting snippets of a
      self-organised fashion show that has been registered fully through the
      all-seeing-eyes of CCTV systems in Youngeun’s hometown of Bucheon, South
      Korea. Over the New Year holidays in 2021, Youngeun initiated a solo
      fashion show there, at her father’s office building wearing her father’s
      clothing.


      Through this intervention, Youngeun hopes to regain some agency in a
      highly mediatised environment, and resist the daily bombardment of
      advertisements on our city streets.


      On Saturday February 19th at 7 pm Youngeun will stand in front of her
      billboard to give a short reading performance. The performance is open to
      visitors and also can be followed through a livestream via the Warehouse |
      A Place for Clothes In Context Instagram account. Follow
      [@amsterdam.warehouse](https://www.instagram.com/amsterdam.warehouse/) for
      updates.


      This performance is part of Youngeun Sohn’s project _Occupying Monitors_
      in Amsterdam and is set up in collaboration with the independent fashion
      magazine _Press & Fold | Notes on making and doing fashion_. Their new
      issue, on the topic of resistance, will launch in May 2022, which includes
      Youngeun Sohn’s contribution _CCTV Catwalk (a.k.a. Growing Pains)_.


      Youngeun Sohn is supported by Arts Council Korea. _Press & Fold | Notes on
      making and doing fashion_ is supported by the Creative Industries Fund.

      This summer will see the release of _Warehouse Review 002_, ‘A Review of
      Reviews’, edited by Hanka van der Voet and Johannes Reponen. _Warehouse
      Review_ examines alternative modes of fashion criticism. With this
      on-going series, we aim to give a proper analysis and contextualisation of
      contemporary fashion phenomena, deploying various methods of research and
      analysis to zoom in on specific aspects that make – in our estimation – a
      fashion phenomenon into what it is. With this second edition of _Warehouse
      Review_, ‘A Review of Reviews’, we are taking a meta approach: we are
      reviewing the fashion review, and in specific, those of the Louis Vuitton
      fall 2020 womenswear collection. Through this meta-critique, we explore
      what we might learn about these past examples of catwalk writing as a way
      to move the discipline forward. It is now time to critique the critic and
      to review the review!


      With contributions by: Aïcha Abbadi, Chinouk Filique de Miranda, Dal
      Chodha, Femke de Vries, Hanka van der Voet, Isabel Mundigo-Moore, Johannes
      Reponen, Laura Gardner, Megan Wray Schertler, Ricarda Bigolin and Sophie
      Barr. Design by Line Arngaard.


      ‘A Review of Reviews’ will be available from mid July onwards through the
      Warehouse webshop and several independent bookstores. This fall the
      official launch will take place through an online event with editors and
      contributors of this edition of the _Warehouse Review_.

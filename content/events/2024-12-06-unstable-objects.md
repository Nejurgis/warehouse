The works in the exhibition respond to the subject of waste by utilising techniques such as reinterpretation and mis-use. The exhibitors have transformed bodily, industrial and personal debris into works that question the value systems at work behind what is treasured and what is cast aside. From a collection of trimmed sleeves, to strands of recently cut hair, an heirloom that has been sitting in a drawer, fabric scraps or hyper gendered garments, all works in the exhibition suggest potential for how to transform, subvert or care for what we leave behind."

      This Sunday March 20th, will see the launch of the first _Reading My
      Panties_ zine, a project initiated by Lu Lin at [W139](https://w139.nl/)
      in Amsterdam. _Reading My Panties_ is a collective zine for the
      underrepresented discussions on panties, drawing on theories of
      intersectionality and feminism. The first issue of the zine, 'A Collective
      Manifesto', includes ten women's stories of scrutinising panties, exposing
      how social constructs—self-objectification, gender regulations,
      conventional chastity, taboos, slut-shaming, body-shaming, etc.— hinder
      women’s sense of safety and feeling at home in their bodies.


      The zine launch of _Reading My Panties_ is a safe space for people to
      openly talk about their panties through interactive panty installations, a
      study-group, and participatory performance. The zine will be on sale at
      the launch.

       The study-group will consist of Lu Lin, Emma van Meyeren, Heike Renée de Wit and Hanka van der Voet (Warehouse), and will start at 15:00 on March 20th. The installation can also be visited the next day, on Monday March 21st.

      The Reading my Panties zine will soon be for sale at the Warehouse
      webshop.


      The Reading My Panties zine launch will take place at W139 on March 20th,
      at Warmoesstraat 139 in Amsterdam. The space will also be open on March
      21st. Both days W139 is open from 12:00 to 18:00.

The official launch moment will take place on Saturday between 16.00-19.00 with an exhibition and a talk with Aimée Zito Lema, Elisa van Joolen and Elisabeth Klement at 17:00. There will also be a reading by Persis Bekkering, poems by Maria Barnas performed by children: Mia, Willem, Hasse, Samuel and Angelina. Moderated by Anik Fournier. DJ set by Cata Pirata. And on Sunday the exhibition will be on view from 12.00–18.00. Free entrance. \r\n\n\r\n\n_Our Rags Magazine_ is a project that investigates transformative processes and proposes new forms of collective production aimed at the reuse of discarded clothing and textiles. \r\n\nBy manufacturing a paper from clothing rags, using it to make garments and subsequently a magazine, the pages of _Our Rags Magazine_ don’t merely show the garments, but are the garments. As such this project and magazine shows the creative potential of recycling garments and textile and questions consumer behaviour.\r\n\n\r\n\nThe project started in 2019 with a workshop in which children were invited to imagine new ways of creating garments and new ways of dressing. The workshop revolved around dissecting discarded pieces of clothing brought in by the participating children. Subsequently, all garments were cut into small pieces and recycled into a new material: paper. A Dutch windmill in Loenen (NL) which still masters the age-old technique of transforming old rags in cotton-based paper transformed the shredded garments into coarse and tactile paper sheets that form the material base of _Our Rags Magazine_. Returned to the workshop participants, the kids collectively made highly imaginative garments from the rags-to-paper material shows in the magazine.\r\n\n\r\n\nDesigned by Elisabeth Klement, the magazine contains contributions by photographer Janneke van der Hagen and writers Maria Barnas and Persis Bekkering.\r\n\n\r\n\nLimited edition of 68 copies. Each copy is unique, handmade, signed and sealed. \r\n\nThe first 25 copies are 350 Euro excl VAT and shipping. \r\n\nCopy 25 – 50 are 450 Euro excl VAT and shipping. \r\n\nLast copies price TBA. \r\n\nAvailable at the launch and via the Warehouse webshop. \r\n\n\r\n\nThe project was supported by Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten, Amsterdam and the Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds.\r\n\n\r\n\nPublished by Warehouse | A Place for Clothes in Context.\r\n\n\r\n\n\r\n\n_Image credit: Our Rags Magazine, Aimée Zito Lema & Elisa van Joolen, 2022.

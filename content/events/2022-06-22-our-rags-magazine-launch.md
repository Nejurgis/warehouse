      _Our Rags Magazine_ is a project that investigates transformative
      processes and proposes new forms of collective production aimed at the
      reuse of discarded clothing and textiles. 


      By manufacturing a paper from clothing rags, using it to make garments and
      subsequently a magazine, the pages of _Our Rags Magazine_ don’t merely
      show the garments, but are the garments. As such this project and magazine
      shows the creative potential of recycling garments and textile and
      questions consumer behaviour.


      The project started in 2019 with a workshop in which children were invited
      to imagine new ways of creating garments and new ways of dressing. The
      workshop revolved around dissecting discarded pieces of clothing brought
      in by the participating children. Subsequently, all garments were cut into
      small pieces and recycled into a new material: paper. A Dutch windmill in
      Loenen (NL) which still masters the age-old technique of transforming old
      rags in cotton-based paper transformed the shredded garments into coarse
      and tactile paper sheets that form the material base of _Our Rags
      Magazine_. Returned to the workshop participants, the kids collectively
      made highly imaginative garments from the rags-to-paper material shows in
      the magazine.


      Designed by Elisabeth Klement, the magazine contains contributions by
      photographer Janneke van der Hagen and writers Maria Barnas and Persis
      Bekkering.


      Limited edition of 68 copies. Each copy is unique, handmade, signed and
      sealed. 


      The first 25 copies are 350 Euro excl VAT and shipping. 


      Copy 25 – 50 are 450 Euro excl VAT and shipping. 


      Last copies price TBA. 


      Available at the launch and via the Warehouse webshop. 


      The project was supported by Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten,
      Amsterdam and the Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds.

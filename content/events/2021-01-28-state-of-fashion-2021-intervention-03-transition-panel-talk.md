      For this panel, focused again on _fashion against capitalism_, we have
      invited practitioners [Aïcha Abbadi](http://www.aichaabbadi.com/),
      [Shanzhai Lyric](https://shanzhailyric.info/) and [Chinouk Filique de
      Miranda](https://www.chinoukfilique.info/). They will elaborate on their
      individual contributions to the multilogue, which revolves around critical
      explorations of non-industrial and non-capitalist fashion. Also joining is
      [T’ai Smith](https://ahva.ubc.ca/persons/tai-smith/), author of the soon
      to be published book _Fashion After Capital_, to deepen their perspectives
      and share her thoughts on the agency of practitioners. The conversation
      will be led by sociologist, fashion theorist and culture critic [Monica
      Titton](https://www.monicatitton.net/). 


      **How can practitioners address and criticize the limits and enclosures of
      a capitalist fashion industry, and what could be ways and tools to opt out
      and create an alternative approach to fashion?**


      The panel takes place on Wednesday 10 February, from 16:00 – 17:30. You
      can register for this free online event by sending an e-mail to
      events@stateoffashion.org including your full name and mentioning
      'Whataboutery 03' in the subject. After registration you will receive a
      confirmation e-mail with more information.


      _Monica Titton_ is a sociologist, fashion theorist and culture critic. She
      currently works as a Senior Scientist at Modeklasse, the Fashion
      Department of the University of Applied Arts Vienna. Her work develops a
      critical, sociological perspective at the intersections of fashion,
      politics, art and identity. Titton’s research is guided by an effort to
      expand and develop theoretical frameworks for critical analyses of
      fashion, and is informed by the traditions of poststructuralism, Marxism,
      feminism and postcolonialism.


      Design researcher and critical fashion practitioner _Chinouk Filique de
      Miranda_ explores the crossover between the fashion system and digital
      culture by focusing on introducing digital literacy in fashion. In her
      practice she approaches fashion as a subliminal communication vehicle
      which she aims to de-mystify in order to inform consumers on complex
      matters regarding individual agency within our current digital culture. In
      her on-going research project ‘[The Algorithmic
      Gaze](https://www.algorithmicgaze.online/)’ the digitization of fashion
      and the new ways the fashion system and its consumers connect and
      communicate through newly acquired technological rhythms is explored and
      explained.


      Through theory and practice, Berlin-based _Aïcha Abbadi_ explores
      fashion’s boundaries and reflects on the discipline itself. She is
      interested in niche fashion practices and alternative ways of making and
      being in fashion, she considers these contributions to be essential for a
      shift in perspective that interrupts fashion’s main narratives. She is
      also invested in neighbourhood initiatives in Berlin that create shared
      community spaces and foster active participation, for creative, culturally
      and socially diverse environments.


      _Shanzhai Lyric_ is a body of research focusing on radical logistics and
      linguistics through the prism of technological aberration and nonofficial
      cultures. The project takes inspiration from the experimental English of
      shanzhai t-shirts made in China and proliferating across the globe to
      examine how the language of counterfeit uses mimicry, hybridity, and
      permutation to both revel in and reveal the artifice of global
      hierarchies. Through an ever-growing archive of poetry-garments, Shanzhai
      Lyric explores the potential of mis-translation and nonsense as utopian
      world-making (breaking) and has previously taken the form of
      poetry-lecture, essay, and installation.


      _T’ai Smith_ is associate professor of modern and contemporary art history
      and media studies at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. Author
      of _Bauhaus Weaving Theory: From Feminine Craft to Mode of Design_
      (University of Minnesota Press, 2014), she has lectured and published
      internationally on textile art, design, and theory. She is currently
      working to complete two book manuscripts: _Fashion After Capital_ and
      _Textile Media: Tangents from Modern to Contemporary Art_.

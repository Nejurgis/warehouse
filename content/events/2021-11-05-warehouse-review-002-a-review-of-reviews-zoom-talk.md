      **About the Warehouse Review 002 | 'A Review of Reviews'**


      In his fall 2020 collection, Nicolas Ghesquière, the creative director of
      Louis Vuitton womenswear, explored notions around time. Talking to Nicole
      Phelps, the Director of Vogue Runway, he stated: “I wanted to imagine what
      could happen if the past could look at us.” With that sentiment in mind,
      the contributors of this Warehouse Review interrogated these, now
      historical written records, that collectively make up a response to Louis
      Vuitton fall 2020 presentation. Through this meta-critique, we hope to
      explore what we might learn about these past examples of catwalk writing
      as a way to move the discipline forward. As McNeil and Miller declared
      “…the reviewer is the critic!” it is now time to critique the critic and
      to review the review.


      With contributions by: Aïcha Abbadi, Chinouk Filique de Miranda, Dal

      Reponen, Laura Gardner, Megan Wray Schertler, Ricarda Bigolin and Sophie
      Barr. Design by Line Arngaard.

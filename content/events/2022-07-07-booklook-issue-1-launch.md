      Booklook Apron-Delantal will be launched officially on Wednesday June
      29th, 20:00 at the Warehouse HQ with a conversation by designer Anouk
      Beckers and artist & researcher María Naidich, moderated by designer
      Andrea Chehade.


      Location: Warehouse HQ, Hamerstraat 2, Amsterdam


      Booklook is a research project by designer Anouk Beckers and fuses the
      fashion magazine with the garment, resulting in a series of wearable
      fashion magazines. The fabric-like paper carries stories that stem from
      the situatedness of garments in non-commercial, cultural, and daily
      realities. Through the experiences and knowledge of invited makers,
      thinkers, designers and writers from various backgrounds the Booklook
      items aim to form a collection of narratives that can help us question and
      reflect on the dominant commercial stories in fashion and redefine the
      role of fashion and garments in a cultural, social, political and economic
      context.


      This Booklook issue shares a text by artist and researcher María Naidich
      about the Tseltalero dress, a garment created and worn by women from both
      Tseltal and Tojolabal communities in the Lacandon jungle, in southeastern
      Mexico. The Tseltalero dress represents an expression of women’s
      resistance to centuries of control over their clothing since the colonial
      times. It is a garment that is produced collectively and strengthens
      relationships between women, allowing them to organize and function
      autonomously. María’s research on this dress is developed in conversation
      with the Tojolabal community of San Gregorio la Esperanza. And explores
      the complex value of this dress within the Tojolabal and Tseltal
      worldview, sharing some ideas about beauty, garments and the body from a
      non-Eurocentric episteme.


      Booklook Apron-Delantal is designed by Rietlanden Women’s Office. Besides
      the contributors’ text it carries a prologue by researcher Femke de Vries.


      Booklook is made with the generous support of Stimuleringsfonds Creative
      Industries, Stichting Stokroos, Lahnpaper and the ArtEZ Fashion
      Professorship.

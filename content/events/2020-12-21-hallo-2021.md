      From the 27th of May till the 5th of June Warehouse | A Place for Clothes
      in Context makes a late entree into 2021 by sharing a series of Warehouse
      publications and films accompanied by a talk on fashion and education at
      San Serriffe. 


      Warehouse aims to facilitate and create an open and critical discourse on
      fashion that goes beyond treating fashion as a commodity. There will be
      two films on show, one of JOIN Collective Clothes by Anouk Beckers and one
      about A Magazine Reader by Lu Lin. Furthermore a series of publications
      will be available which are produced and/or selected by Warehouse such as
      _D&K Lookbook, Mode & Mode, JOIN, PORTAL, Press & Fold, A Magazine Reader,
      Fat Belly Boy Booklet, Monument, Rework Magazine_ and _Collective
      Wandering_. 


      During the talk on Thursday the 27th at 20:00, curator David Smeulders (de
      Appel), artist Lu Lin and Warehouse members Anouk Beckers and Elisa van
      Joolen will talk about education in relation to fashion; how do we learn
      about, with and through fashion? We will be exploring ideas on collective
      learning, sharing, the role of publishing and activation towards agency
      and ownership.


      You can watch the live talk on San Serriffe's [Instagram
      page](https://www.instagram.com/san.serriffe/?hl=en), or on our own
      [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/amsterdam.warehouse/?hl=en).


      You can also find more information about the event on San Serriffe's

      To enter 2021 in style Warehouse will be giving away free Warehouse
      shoelaces with every purchase at San Serriffe during this period.

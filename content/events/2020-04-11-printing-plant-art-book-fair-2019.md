          Warehouse participates in Printing Plant Art Book fair with a selection of
          independent fashion publications.


          As Warehouse aims to create an engaging environment that facilitates
          dialogue and an alternative fashion discourse that goes beyond seeing
          fashion as a commodity, Warehouse supported and produced a number of
          projects that explore the trademarks of fashion with a critical eye.
          Warehouse sells several publications like: the *JOIN manual* and the *JOIN
          Collective Conversation* magazine,  issues of *A Magazine Reader*, as well
          as issues of the *PORTAL* readers. There's an exclusive pre-sale of the
          newest *Press & Fold* 'The Luxury issue' and several items of Warehouse
          Wear.


          Just like last year, we've made a selection of independent fashion
          publications. This year, we have publications by Chet Bugter, Chinouk
          Filique de Miranda, Edwin van Gelder & Johann Tangyong (*Rework*
          magazine), Mary-Lou Berkulin (*Monument*), Karmen Samson, Mika Perlmutter
          and Rebecca Stephany (in collaboration with students from the Karlsruhe
          University of Arts and Design).

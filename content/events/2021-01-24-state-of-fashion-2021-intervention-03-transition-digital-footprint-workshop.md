      Whether you are using social media a lot or more occasionally, they
      influence our life. Maybe even more than you know? Within this Digital
      Footprint Workshop guided by [Chinouk Filique de
      Miranda](https://www.chinoukfilique.info/), you will look for the way in
      which you position yourself as a user-consumer within your personal
      digital landscape. By investigating your ‘scrolling behaviour’ while using
      new media platforms and its algorithms, in order to analyse your personal
      digital footprint, we will try to find and highlight interrelated
      (subliminal) commercial structures. During the session you will translate
      your findings into something visually tangible, that reinterprets your
      digital environment. This enables you to reclaim some agency in the
      digital landscape. Something which is maybe more relevant than you think
      now..


      _What is a digital footprint?_


      One’s digital footprint contains information about a particular person
      that exists on the Internet as a result of their online activity. In
      abstract form, it is a unique set of traceable digital activities,
      actions, contributions and communications manifested on the Internet and
      through the use of digital devices.


      CHINOUK FILIQUE DE MIRANDA


      Chinouk is the author of the third part of the multilogue and will be
      organizing the Digital Footprint Workshop on Sunday January 31st.


      Chinouk Filique de Miranda, a design researcher and critical fashion
      practitioner, aims to explore the crossover between the fashion system and
      digital culture by focusing on introducing digital literacy in fashion. In
      her practice she approaches fashion as a subliminal communication vehicle
      which she aims to de-mystify in order to inform consumers on complex
      matters regarding individual agency within our current digital culture.


      In her on-going research project ‘[The Algorithmic
      Gaze](https://www.algorithmicgaze.online/)’, the digitization of fashion
      and the new ways the fashion system and its consumers connect and
      communicate through newly acquired technological rhythms is explored and
      explained.


      The workshop takes place on Sunday 31 January, from 12:30 – 15:30. You can
      register for this free online workshop by sending an e-mail to
      events@stateoffashion.org including your full name and mentioning 'Therapy
      Session' in the subject. After registration you will receive a
      confirmation e-mail with more information.

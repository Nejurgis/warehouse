          A conversation between Elisa van Joolen, Hanka van der Voet and students
          from MA Fashion Strategy generation 27 exploring the following: Could
          different garments worn by different people be related? In what ways are
          emotional and monetary values of clothing connected? To whom does a piece
          of clothing belong?

          *PORTAL* is a research project that explores the economic, social and
          emotional value of clothing and offers a ‘way in’ to understanding
          garments from a multitude of overlapping and intersecting perspectives.


          For every edition, participants are asked to take off a garment, lay it
          down on a large Tyvek sheet, outline their garment with tape and answer a
          series of questions regarding its production (Where was it made?),
          materials (What is it made of?), ownership (Is it yours?) and value (How
          much did it cost? What is the emotional value?). Subsequently connections
          are made between the garments by literally drawing lines between the items
          of the various visitors, creating a network that reveals connections
          between and intersections of personal, economic, social, cultural and
          political realms surfacing a complex and layered system of the reality of
          clothing.This culminates in a map, or landscape of personal stories that
          connect to form a fashion network which inverts our gaze, shining a
          spotlight on the intricacies of our own outfits and extraordinary aspects
          of the everyday as opposed to the myth of the exclusive fashion image.
          *PORTAL* thus provides an entryway to a vision that begins to prioritise
          values that are ephemeral and yet integral in “influencing hearts and
          minds and shaping the way we live together”. It captures and visualises
          information that circumvents established hierarchies and disrupts the
          homogeneity of the commercially driven fashion system with the refreshing
          diversity of fashion that is worn; embodied and imperfect.


          The collected information of each *PORTAL* edition is visualized and
          brought together in a reader using the sixteen *PORTAL* questions as a
          starting point.


          For *PORTAL 001* Elisa van Joolen worked with MA Fashion Strategy students
          generation 27 to research the economic, social and emotional value of
          clothing worn by visitors of the *Change the System* exhibition at Museum
          Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam. Information on 159 pieces of clothing
          worn by visitors was collected. The collected data is visualized and
          brought together in a reader designed by Beau Bertens.

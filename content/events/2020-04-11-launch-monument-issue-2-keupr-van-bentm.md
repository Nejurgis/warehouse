      A conversation with Mary-Lou Berkulin, Mo Veld and Keupr/van Bentm
      (Michiel Keuper and Francisco van Benthum).


      On January 16, the second issue of *Monument* was published, a fanzine
      dedicated to the 'Dutch Wave', a group of Dutch fashion designers who
      created international fame around the turn of the century. Each number is
      dedicated to one designer or design duo. This second issue focuses on the
      work of the duo Keupr/van Bentm (Michiel Keuper and Francisco van
      Benthum). Between 1997 and 2001, they challenged the fashion industry with
      their surprising and colorful statement collections.


      In *Monument*, a project by stylist and fashion researcher Mary-Lou
      Berkulin and graphic designer Karen van der Kraats, images and texts from
      various archives are combined with new interviews and photography. Each
      issue has its own unique design and editorial approach, completely in
      keeping with the designer to whom the issue is dedicated. Central to this
      paper monument for Keupr/van Bentm is the work that they made between 1997
      and 2001. A conversation between Mary-Lou Berkulin and Keupr/van Bentm has
      been supplemented with quotes and texts from articles from the archive and
      a new long-read, written by fashion researcher Laura Gardner. The items
      from the archive have been photographed by Roos Quakernaat.

      In addition to original images from the designers' archives, *Monument*
      also contains newly created photography. For this issue Mary-Lou Berkulin
      collaborated with photographer Roos Quakernaat. She took pictures in the
      depot of the Centraal Museum in Utrecht, where the most special items from
      Keupr/van Bentm have been carefully stored. In addition, together with
      Mary-Lou, she created a new fashion series in which she combines her own
      photography with clothing from the designers' archives into surprising
      collages.

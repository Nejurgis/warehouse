      Avoidstreet is a multidisciplinary studio founded in 2017 by Graphic
      Designer Eduardo León. The Amsterdam-based creative studio fuses fashion,
      graphic design and performance. Through collections, collaborations,
      exhibitions and workshops, Avoidstreet has developed a unique vocabulary
      rooted in remixing cultural techniques. This has resulted in a distinctive
      brand identity captured by its slogan: “Clothes, Jpegs & Lyrics.”

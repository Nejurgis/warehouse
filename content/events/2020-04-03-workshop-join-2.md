          This *JOIN Collective Clothes* workshop at
          [fanfare](https://fanfarefanfare.nl/), in collaboration with [studio
          bonbon](http://www.studiobonbon.org/) is part of a series of workshops by
          Anouk Beckers in which everyone is invited to make a piece of a garment. 


          The base of JOIN Collective Clothes is a modular clothing system that
          consists of four different shapes which can be combined into a full outfit
          (a sleeve, a top, a trouser leg and a part of a skirt). The materials used
          during this workshop were offered especially by Studio Bonbon: printed
          textile which were functioning as table cloths during the relaunch of the
          studio in 2018. At the end of the workshop, the results from the
          participants were joined into one complete outfit. This result was
          exhibited at fanfare from 02.10.2019 to 06.10.2019 as part of the
          exhibition [Studio Bonbon
          Invites](https://fanfarefanfare.nl/1659-studio-bonbon-invites).


          The process of the workshop is playful, but at the same time it critically
          questions the characteristics of the fashion system exploring ownership,
          identity, (intellectual) property, production methods, alienation,
          mystification and value creation in fashion together. 


          Initiator Anouk Beckers on JOIN Collective Clothes: “What if we open up
          the fashion system and explore it as a non-fixed entity, a system where
          people can playfully join in, where everyone is invited to create fashion
          together?”


          The fashion industry focuses mostly on designer status, brand identity,
          commodities as magical results of invisible processes and an adoration of
          values such as originality and ‘the new’. And although it is often
          perceived as something that is not for everyone, fashion surely is a
          collective practice. By making and wearing clothes together, the design
          and research project JOIN Collective Clothes proposes fashion as a
          collective practice. Besides joining one of the workshop, an easy-to-use
          open source can be downloaded at the [JOIN
          website](https://www.joincollectiveclothes.com/manual) or from
          [here](https://www.thisiswarehouse.com/shop/2020-04-11-join-collective-clothes-manual/).
          The pieces made by various makers from all over the world form an
          ever-growing collection that can be seen on the JOIN Collective Clothes
          website.


          [JOIN Collective Clothes](https://www.joincollectiveclothes.com/) is an
          initiative by Anouk Beckers in collaboration with graphic designer and art
          director [Beau Bertens](http://beaubertens.nl/).


          Studio Bonbon is a textile printing studio founded in 1979. The printing
          workshop closed its doors in 1988, but Studio Bonbon kept on existing. As
          daughter of the founder, Teuntje Kranenborg decided to continue on the
          studio, among other things creating silkscreen printed textiles.

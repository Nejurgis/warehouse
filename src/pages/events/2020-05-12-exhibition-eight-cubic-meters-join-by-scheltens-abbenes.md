      *Eight Cubic Meters by JOIN Collective Clothes* shows the result of a
      collaboration between JOIN Collective Clothes, an initiative by Anouk
      Beckers and photographers Maurice Scheltens and Liesbeth Abbenes. This
      exhibition is on view from 01.07.2020 - 22.09.2020. Open 24/7 in Sint
      Nicolaasstraat, Amsterdam. 


      A series of images, titled*JOIN Collective Clothes with Scheltens &
      Abbenes,*captures a selection of works which are made with the JOIN
      approach; a modular clothing system that invites people to make garments
      together and explore fashion as a collective practice. In the background
      of every photo you see the black-lined JOIN patterns; a set of shapes –
      top (J), sleeve (O), trouser leg (I), part of a skirt (N)– that can
      connect through regular placed attachment marks. Anyone can participate by
      choosing one of these shapes and making their own JOIN piece which can
      eventually be connected to a piece made by another maker. The simplicity
      of the modular JOIN system, which functions as the fundament of the
      project, is translated into an open source manual, designed by Beau
      Bertens, which makes it possible for everyone to join. Regardless of
      location and experience, either working from home, or participating in one
      of the JOIN workshops, JOIN creates the possibility to come together,
      share ideas and experiment with form, texture, technique and material.

      *Eight Cubic Meters by JOIN Collective Clothes* shows the result of a
      collaboration between JOIN Collective Clothes, an initiative by Anouk
      Beckers and photographers Maurice Scheltens and Liesbeth Abbenes. This
      exhibition is on view from 01.07.2020 - 22.09.2020. Open 24/7 in Sint
      Nicolaasstraat, Amsterdam. 


      A series of images, titled *JOIN Collective Clothes with Scheltens &
      Abbenes,* captures a selection of works which are made with the JOIN
      approach; a modular clothing system that invites people to make garments
      together and explore fashion as a collective practice. In the background
      of every photo you see the black-lined JOIN patterns; a set of shapes –
      top (J), sleeve (O), trouser leg (I), part of a skirt (N)– that can
      connect through regular placed attachment marks. Anyone can participate by
      choosing one of these shapes and making their own JOIN piece which can
      eventually be connected to a piece made by another maker. The simplicity
      of the modular JOIN system, which functions as the fundament of the
      project, is translated into an open source manual, designed by Beau
      Bertens, which makes it possible for everyone to join. Regardless of
      location and experience, either working from home, or participating in one
      of the JOIN workshops, JOIN creates the possibility to come together,
      share ideas and experiment with form, texture, technique and material.


      Brought together, the pieces from different makers with various
      backgrounds and experience form a series of garments that encapsulate an
      explorative and collaborative process of garment design and making. Made
      by Scheltens and Abbenes, these images show the work of a commissioned
      designer combined with a work made during one of the JOIN workshops. The
      flat textile shapes, with some 3D elements, are presented like a landscape
      of abstract geometric shapes interchanged with clear garment-related
      references. Captured in these visual landscapes, the images show how the
      various makers use the JOIN patterns differently; their personal choices
      coming to the surface in form, texture, technique and material, showing
      the endless possibilities within the modular JOIN system. Hinting towards
      garments and the potentiality of the bare pattern at the same time, the
      visualization of these fragments presents us with the infinite possible
      assemblages of this ongoing project. How would the sleeve of one maker
      combine with the top of another? Together the images thus present the main
      goal of the project; exploring the relation between various disciplines
      and backgrounds, the individual maker and the collective, the commissioned
      designer and the workshop participant.


      The project can be viewed on
      [www.joincollectiveclothes.com](www.joincollectiveclothes.com) where the
      various pieces, made by different makers, are brought together in one
      archive, a collective collection.\

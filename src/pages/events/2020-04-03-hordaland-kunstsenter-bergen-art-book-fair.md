      Warehouse will join Hordaland Kunstsenter at the Bergen Art Book Fair with
      a selection of independent fashion publications.


      As Warehouse aims to create an engaging environment that facilitates
      dialogue and an alternative fashion discourse that goes beyond seeing
      fashion as a commodity Warehouse supported and produced a number of
      projects that explore with a critical eye the trademarks of fashion.


      Warehouse is selling several publications such as the *JOIN* manual and
      the *JOIN Collective Conversation* magazines, issues of *A Magazine
      Reader*, as well as issues of the *PORTAL* readers, *Press & Fold '*The
      Street Issue' and several items of Warehouse Wear.

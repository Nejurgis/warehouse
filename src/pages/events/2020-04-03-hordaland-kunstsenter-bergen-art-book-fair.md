Warehouse joins Hordaland Kunstsenter at the Bergen Art Book Fair with a selection of independent fashion publications.

As Warehouse aims to create an engaging environment that facilitates dialogue and an alternative fashion discourse that goes beyond seeing fashion as a commodity Warehouse supported and produced a number of projects that explore with a critical eye, the trademarks of fashion. \
Weâ€™ll be selling several Warehouse publications: the *JOIN manual* and the *JOIN Collective Conversation* magazine. There will also be several issues of *A Magazine Reader* for sale, as well as issues of the *PORTAL* readers and *Press & Fold*. We will also be showing several items of *Warehouse Wear*.

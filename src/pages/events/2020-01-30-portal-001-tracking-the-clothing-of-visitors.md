A conversation between Elisa van Joolen, Hanka van der Voet and students from MA Fashion Strategy generation #27 exploring the following: could different garments worn by different people be related? In what ways are emotional and monetary values of clothing connected? To whom does a piece of clothing belong?

*PORTAL*is a research project thatexplores the economic, social and emotional value of clothingand offers a ‘way in’ to understanding garments from a multitude of overlapping and intersecting perspectives.\
For every edition, participants are asked to take off a garment, lay it down on a large Tyvek sheet, outline their garment with tape and answer a series of questions regarding its production (Where was it made?), materials (What is it made of?), ownership (Is it yours?) and value (How much did it cost? What is the emotional value?).Subsequently connections are made between the garments by literally drawing lines between the items of the various visitors, creating a network that reveals connections between and intersections of personal, economic, social, cultural and political realms surfacing a complex and layered system of the reality of clothing.This culminates in a map, or landscape of personal stories that connect to form a new fashion network.The collected information of each Portal edition is subsequently visualized and brought together in a reader using the sixteen*PORTAL*questions as their starting point.

For *PORTAL 001* Elisa van Joolen worked with students from the MA Fashion Strategy programme of ArtEZ University of the Arts to research the economic, social and emotional value of clothing worn by visitors of the ‘Change the System’ exhibition at Museum Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam. Information on 159 pieces of clothing worn by visitors was collected. The collected data is visualized and brought together in a reader designed by Beau Bertens.

      If circumstances permit it, somewhere this summer the first edition of the
      *Warehouse Review* will be launched, titled ‘People Wearing Off-White’.


      ‘People Wearing Off-White’ initially started as the documentation of a
      personal fascination with the overwhelming presence of a yellow industrial
      belt and a logo with crossed arrows on the streets of Amsterdam. What was
      it, and where did it originate from? And why was it so popular? At the end
      of the summer of 2019, Hanka van der Voet started documenting people
      wearing Off-White she came across on the street and putting these in her
      stories on her Instagram account with the hashtag #peoplewearingoffwhite,
      asking her followers to send in their images as well. In five months time,
      she collected over two hundred images of people wearing Off-White.
      Starting of as a fascination the collecting of images quickly turned into
      a fascination with Off-White designer Virgil Abloh, and the immense
      popularity of his brand.


      *Warehouse Review* has the aim to explore alternative modes of fashion
      criticism. With the series, we aim to give a proper analysis and
      contextualisation of certain contemporary fashion phenomena, but not only
      through an essayistic approach. We deploy various methods of research and
      analysis to zoom in on specific aspects that make – in our estimation – a
      fashion phenomenon into what it is. In the case of Virgil Abloh’s
      Off-White this means addressing his language, analysing Off-White’s
      Instagram presence and providing a new perspective on one of Off-White’s
      most popular product: the yellow industrial belt. This zine will kick off
      with an essay that zooms in on Off-White’s DNA: how the brand came into
      being, in what context it exists – not just in terms of the fashion
      system, but society at large – and what tactics are used to achieve a
      certain brand image.


      *Warehouse Review I | People Wearing Off-White* will feature contributions
      by Chinouk Filique de Miranda, Denise Bernts, Femke de Vries and Hanka van
      der Voet. Design by Line Arngaard.


      The zine will not be available through sale, but can be obtained through
      swapping only.

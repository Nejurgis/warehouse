Warehouse participates in Printing Plant Art Book Fair with a selection of independent fashion publications. Also, Beau Bertens, Elisa van Joolen, Femke de Vries, Jan Schoon and Mary-Lou Berkulin have a conversation about independent fashion publishing.

As Warehouse aims to create an engaging environment that facilitates dialogue and an alternative fashion discourse that goes beyond seeing fashion as a commodity Warehouse supported and produced a number of projects that explore with a critical eye, the trademarks of fashion. Some of these projects are *PORTAL*, *Press & Fold*, *A Magazine Reader* and *Monument*. During their talk at Printing Plant, Femke de Vries and Elisa van Joolen, along with Jan Schoon, Mary-Lou Berkulin (*Monument*) and Beau Bertens (*Press & Fold*), share insights on how they dissect fashion magazines, make fashion publications, approach the garment as carrier and medium and redefine the role of the wearer and the maker.\

We will also be selling a curated selection of independent fashion publications. This year, we selected Chet Bugter, Rosita Kaer, Stijn Pomm√©e and Zoe Philine to join us.

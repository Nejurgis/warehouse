Warehouse is an Amsterdam based platform initiated by Elisa van Joolen, Femke de Vries and Hanka van der Voet that aims to provide a place for critical fashion practitioners by creating an engaging environment that facilitates dialogue and an alternative fashion discourse that goes beyond seeing fashion as a commodity. Recently, Warehouse has supported and produced a number of projects that explore with a critical eye, the trademarks of fashion. Some of these projects are _PORTAL_, _Press & Fold_, _A Magazine Reader_ and _Monument_. During their talk at Printing Plant, Femke de Vries and Elisa van Joolen, along with Jan Schoon, Mary-Lou Berkulin (_Monument_) and Beau Bertens (_Press & Fold_), will share insights on how they dissect fashion magazines, make fashion publications, approach the garment as carrier and medium and redefine the role of the wearer and the maker.

Warehouse is also part of the Printing Plant Art Book Fair, selling copies of their publications as well as offering a curated selection of student publications.

Warehouse will again participate in the Printing Plant Art Book Fair this year, hosted by Looiersgracht 60. We’ll be selling several Warehouse publications: Anouk Beckers will present both the JOIN manual and the *JOIN Collective Conversation* magazine, created in collaboration with MA Fashion Strategy students generation #29. There will also be several issues of *A Magazine Reader* by Femke de Vries and Hanka van der Voet for sale, as well as issues of the *PORTAL* readers created by Elisa van Joolen. We’ll do an exclusive pre-sale of the newest *Press & Fold* - The Luxury issue - by Hanka van der Voet and Beau Bertens, which will come out in the first week of December. We will also be showing several items of Warehouse Wear.

And just like last year, we will be selling a curated selection of independent fashion publications. This year, we selected Chet Bugter, Chinouk Filique de Miranda, Edwin van Gelder & Johann Tangyong (*Rework* magazine), Karmen Samson, Mika Perlmutter and Rebecca Stephany (in collaboration with students from the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design) to join us.

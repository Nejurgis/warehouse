Warehouse will be at Printing Plant Art Book fair with a selection of independent fashion publications.

As Warehouse aims to create an engaging environment that facilitates dialogue and an alternative fashion discourse that goes beyond seeing fashion as a commodity Warehouse supported and produced a number of projects that explore with a critical eye, the trademarks of fashion. \
We’ll be selling several Warehouse publications: the JOIN manual and the *JOIN Collective Conversation* magazine. There will also be several issues of *A Magazine Reader* for sale, as well as issues of the *PORTAL* readers. We’ll do an exclusive pre-sale of the newest *Press & Fold* - The Luxury issue. We will also be showing several items of Warehouse Wear.

And just like last year, we will be selling a selection of independent fashion publications. This year, we'll bring publications by Chet Bugter, Chinouk Filique de Miranda, Edwin van Gelder & Johann Tangyong (*Rework* magazine), Monument Magazine, Karmen Samson, Mika Perlmutter and Rebecca Stephany (in collaboration with students from the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design).

Warehouse is an Amsterdam-based collective existing of Elisa van Joolen, Femke de Vries and Hanka van der Voet aiming to provide a platform for critical fashion practitioners through organizing exhibitions, reading groups, workshops, performances and book presentations among other things, in order to create an engaging environment that facilitates critical dialogue and the creation of an alternative fashion discourse that goes beyond seeing fashion as a commodity.

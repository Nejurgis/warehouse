      A conversation with Rebecca Stephany and Amelia Groom on *200 Sisters
      Souvenirs* accompanied by a presentation of the *200 Sisters Souvenirs*
      clothing and accessoiries.


      *200 Sisters Souvenirs – 200 years of exhibition* catalogues, side notes
      and slippery images, a feminist exhibition (mis)reading is a project by
      Rebecca Stephany developed on the occasion of the 200-year anniversary of
      The Baden Art Association (Badischer Kunstverein) in Karlsruhe in 2018.


      The project is the result of an intensive exploration of the catalogue
      archive of Badischer Kunstverein from a decidedly slippery feminist point
      of view. Drawing from the archive, which consists of over 300 catalogues
      and monographs, Stephany developed a publication with an accompanying line
      of merchandise. In addition, current members of Badischer Kunstverein were
      invited to donate a piece of used clothing in exchange for a modified one,
      with a process resulting in an edition of logo-bleached and modified
      second-hand garments and accessories.


      The project transposes methodologies of uncovering, misreading and
      zooming-in from the archival research to wearable and useable objects. In
      reference to low-fi souvenir articles found in museum shops, the
      merchandise ranges from key chains, eyewear straps and bookmarks to
      custom-made woven ribbons featuring text fragments from the catalogue
      archive. Weaving is taken up as an analogy for joining forces, while
      bleaching is deployed throughout as a “printing” method, with the 200
      Sisters logo inscribed through the removal of dye, as a model for
      uncovering what is there but hidden.

      “In my approach to the BKV catalogue archive, consciously misreading
      discriminatory or otherwise questionable material, became my method of
      disrupting the predominantly male-dominated writing of art history, of
      which the exhibition history of Badischer Kunstverein is only one of many
      examples. But the act of “misreading” is also very much about celebrating
      the many unknown women depicted in painting and sculpture and the few
      female, queer or otherwise marginalised artists in the 200-year history of
      Badischer Kunstverein. Instead of claiming moral and political
      correctness, I am pointing to the side notes and allow the images to be
      slippery and potent with alternative, emancipatory, at times absurd or
      humorous meanings.” – Rebecca Stephany.


      Following the 200 Sisters Souvenirs presentation by Rebecca Stephany,
      writer Amelia Groom will give a personal response to the project, focusing
      on questions of historical erasure as well as the possibilities of
      bleach-inscriptions within feminist responses to archival inheritance.

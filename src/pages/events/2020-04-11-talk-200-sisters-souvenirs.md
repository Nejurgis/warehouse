      A conversation with Rebecca Stephany and Amelia Groom on 200 Sisters
      Souvenirs accompanied by a presentation of the 200 Sisters Souvenirs
      clothing and accessoiries.


      200 Sisters Souvenirs – 200 years of exhibition catalogues, side notes and
      slippery images, a feminist exhibition (mis)reading is a project by
      Rebecca Stephany developed on the occasion of the 200-year anniversary of
      The Baden Art Association (Badischer Kunstverein) in Karlsruhe in 2018.


      The project is the result of an intensive exploration of the catalogue
      archive of Badischer Kunstverein from a decidedly slippery feminist point
      of view. Drawing from the archive, which consists of over 300 catalogues
      and monographs, Stephany developed a publication with an accompanying line
      of merchandise. In addition, current members of Badischer Kunstverein were
      invited to donate a piece of used clothing in exchange for a modified one,
      with a process resulting in an edition of logo-bleached and modified
      second-hand garments and accessories.


      The project transposes methodologies of uncovering, misreading and
      zooming-in from the archival research to wearable and useable objects. In
      reference to low-fi souvenir articles found in museum shops, the
      merchandise ranges from key chains, eyewear straps and bookmarks to
      custom-made woven ribbons featuring text fragments from the catalogue
      archive. Weaving is taken up as an analogy for joining forces, while
      bleaching is deployed throughout as a “printing” method, with the 200
      Sisters logo inscribed through the removal of dye, as a model for
      uncovering what is there but hidden.

Is it a strange confession to say that, when starting this project, I looked up the word ‘fashion’ in a dictionary? The fact that in its explanation the word ‘transitory’ was mentioned as a characteristic of the word fashion was enough to affirm my thoughts.

Not long before then, I had visited the storage space belonging to Jeroen Teunissen where we searched together for designs from 'Candescere', the last finished collection of Rozema/Teunissen, the fashion label he and Melanie Rozema had from 1997 till 2001. I took home some designs that I, until that time, only knew from magazines, pictures of catwalk shows or museum-displays, and that were now crammed in a couple of shopping bags, hanging on the steer of my bike.

Rozema/Teunissen’s designs are part of a defining time in Dutch Fashion. With their work, they have paved the way for generations. But unfortunately, until today, their heritage is not tangible or visible. The majority of their archive is analogue and put together before the rise of social media and the internet. The items are held in bags, folders, in storage spaces and attics. Some lucky pieces have made it into the museum depot where they quietly lie, wrapped in acid-free paper, carefully held in climate-controlled spaces. Although this is a comfortable situation, it’s the reason they remain far from our memory. It’s a place unworthy of their essence.

*Monument* aims to bring these items back to the surface. By doing so, I want to show you that we maybe first need to look back in order to move forward into changing today’s fashion system. This work might show us some valuable insights on that matter, as Rozema/Teunissen were well ahead of their time, not only by creating designs averse to prevailing trends, but also by working with subjects such as recycling. This is the first publication fully dedicated to their work, and brings together a selection of images from the designer’s original archive, illustrated with quotes and excerpts from the conversations we had over the last couple of months.

Together these bits and pieces will tell you more about the designers; their inspirations, experiences and also, struggles. Renee van der Hoek’s contribution on page 34 puts Rozema/Teunissen’s work into a broader perspective, featuring a closer look on the coming and passing of the label as a part of the 1998 ‘Dutch Wave’. This is not only the story of a young, talented label, bursting with ambition and creativity, but also a story about how external factors, both local and global, can have an impact on creatives and ultimately change their perspectives.

After almost 20 years since they’ve been made, Rozema/Teunissen’s designs still embody an exceptionally modern look, and photographer Barrie Hullegie beautifully caught this in the three stories we created together with items from the archive. In our constant hunger for new fashion we have forgotten about the artistry that is fashion design and the amount of energy and dedication it takes for a designer to create their work. Glossies, social media and the internet are happy to help you long for change, by constantly emphasizing on ‘what’s new’. Whilst autonomous artists create a body of work during the length of their career, fashion designers are expected to reinvent themselves several times per year which subsequently, makes their previous work look irrelevant to the public. This fascinating side of fashion is the reason why this first edition is dedicated to Rozema/Teunissen. They deserve a *Monument* for creating work that goes well beyond fashion’s transitory aspect.

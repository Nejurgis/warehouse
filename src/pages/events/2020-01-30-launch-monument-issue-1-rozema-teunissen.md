      This launch of Monument Issue #1 | Rozema/Teunissen at Sexyland coincides
      with an installation by Maria Kley.\

      \

      On June 20, the first issue of *Monument* was published, a fanzine
      dedicated to the "Dutch Wave", a group of Dutch fashion designers who
      created international fame around the turn of the century. Each number is
      dedicated to one designer or design duo. This second issue focuses on the
      work of the duo Rozema/Teunissen (Melanie Rozema and Jeroen Teunissen).


      In *Monument*, a project by stylist and fashion researcher Mary-Lou
      Berkulin and graphic designer Karen van der Kraats, images and texts from
      various archives are combined with new interviews and photography. Each
      issue has its own unique design and editorial approach, completely in
      keeping with the designer to whom the issue is dedicated. A conversation
      between Mary-Lou and Rozema/Teunissen has been supplemented with quotes
      and texts from articles from the archive and a new long-read, written by
      fashion researcher Renée van der Hoek. The items from the archive have
      been photographed by Barrie Hullegie.\

      Some words by initiator Mary Lou Berkulin from the introduction of this
      first edition of Monument:


      “*Rozema/Teunissen’s* designs are part of a defining time in Dutch
      Fashion. With their work, they have paved the way for generations. But
      unfortunately, until today, their heritage is not tangible or visible. The
      majority of their archive is analogue and put together before the rise of
      social media and the internet. The items are held in bags, folders, in
      storage spaces and attics. Some lucky pieces have made it into the museum
      depot where they quietly lie, wrapped in acid-free paper, carefully held
      in climate-controlled spaces. Although this is a comfortable situation,
      it’s the reason they remain far from our memory. It’s a place unworthy of
      their essence”.


      *“Monument* aims to bring these items back to the surface. By doing so, I
      want to show you that we maybe first need to look back in order to move
      forward into changing today’s fashion system”.\

      \

      “This is not only the story of a young, talented label, bursting with
      ambition and creativity, but also a story about how external factors, both
      local and global, can have an impact on creatives and ultimately change
      their perspectives”.


      “After almost 20 years since they’ve been made, *Rozema/Teunissen*’s
      designs still embody an exceptionally modern look, and photographer Barrie
      Hullegie beautifully caught this in the three stories we created together
      with items from the archive. In our constant hunger for new fashion we
      have forgotten about the artistry that is fashion design and the amount of
      energy and dedication it takes for a designer to create their work.
      Glossies, social media and the internet are happy to help you long for
      change, by constantly emphasizing on ‘what’s new’. Whilst autonomous
      artists create a body of work during the length of their career, fashion
      designers are expected to reinvent themselves several times per year which
      subsequently, makes their previous work look irrelevant to the public.
      This fascinating side of fashion is the reason why this first edition is
      dedicated to Rozema/Teunissen. They deserve a *Monument* for creating work
      that goes well beyond fashion’s transitory aspect".

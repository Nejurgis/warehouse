      Warehouse participates in Printing Plant Art Book fair with a selection of
      independent fashion publications.


      As Warehouse aims to create an engaging environment that facilitates
      dialogue and an alternative fashion discourse that goes beyond seeing
      fashion as a commodity, Warehouse supported and produced a number of
      projects that explore the trademarks of fashion with a critical eye.

      Warehouse sells several publications like: the *JOIN manual* and the *JOIN
      Collective Conversation* magazine. Several issues of *A Magazine Reader*,
      as well as issues of the *PORTAL* readers. There's an exclusive pre-sale
      of the newest *Press & Fold* - The Luxury issue and several items of
      Warehouse Wear.


      And just like last year, we've made a selection of independent fashion
      publications. This year, we have publications by Chet Bugter, Chinouk
      Filique de Miranda, Edwin van Gelder & Johann Tangyong (*Rework*
      magazine), Mary-Lou Berkulin (*Monument*), Karmen Samson, Mika Perlmutter
      and Rebecca Stephany (in collaboration with students from the Karlsruhe
      University of Arts and Design).

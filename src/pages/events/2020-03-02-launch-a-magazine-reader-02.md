Join the students of MA Fashion Strategy gen #28 for the launch of the second edition of _A Magazine Reader 02_, Issue November 2018, on June 22, 14:00, Kleine Oord 175 Arnhem. The students will give insight into the process of creating this edition of _A Magazine Reader_, which focuses on language in fashion magazines and how this affects our relationship to fashion. _A Magazine Reader_ is the result of a workshop where a specific issue of a fashion magazine is completely dissected, analysed and put together again in an alternative format.

For this issue we have focused on reading each and every word. This process of dissecting and analysing reveals the actual structure and content of the magazine. (Which words are used? Is it readable at all? Is the meaning clear? Which values are given precedence? Which brands are represented? What are the topics covered (or left out)? How are they ordered in the magazine? Where are the page numbers?) Most importantly it uncovers opportunities for the re-definition and re-imagination of these texts and their intentions. Each contribution to this edition of _A Magazine Reader_ takes on a slightly different reader perspective, unravelling a particular aspect of embedded meaning and value and reframing it in a broader social and cultural context. Together they remind us that becoming aware of our position as readers means we become aware of our position to shape and create fashion.

The workshop was initiated by Femke de Vries and Hanka van der Voet. This edition was made in close collaboration with Ruby Hoette, Chet Bugter and the students of MA Fashion Strategy gen #28. Graphic design by Corine van der Wal. Printed by Risowiso. Talk during the launch moderated by Chet Bugter.

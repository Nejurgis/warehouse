During this conversation, taking place in a mini-exhibition, Femke de Vries, Chet Bugter and Zuzana Kostelanská discuss the proces of making *A Magazine Reader 03*, which revolves around all the non-garment related elements in the fashion magazine. 

*A Magazine Reader* revolves around the analysis of a mainstream and high-end fashion magazine and its translation into an alternative new zine to provide insight into the cultural power and forms of value production that is at the core of fashion media. In it, the reader becomes an active actor in the construct of fashion. Re-reading the magazine by dissecting it, analysing the words, images, materiality, the items shown on the pages and the strategies of the specific magazine changes the way we read fashion.

In the workshop one specific magazine is selected. This magazine is thoroughly read, dissected and critically analysed on elements such as models, topicality, advertisements, material, brands, distribution, imagery, items, narrative, monetary value, colours, words and order of pages. By not starting from the perspective of the fashion system at large, but from the simple act of reading a fashion magazine, the reader gains an active role. Having the material in hands, seeing the images, how brands are being represented on the pages, reading the words and tracing the page numbers, but also feeling the paper, the weight and being able to smell the magazine creates an awareness of the magazine as a material object. Something that embodies and communicates the process of value production in fashion. A material representation of fashion’s ephemerality, dream worlds and fantasies.

The readers in the workshop use the material of the original ‘source magazine’ to create a new zine that provides insight into the cultural power and forms of value production that is at the core of fashion media. The existing material is elaborated on by connecting with other material (theories, visuals, artistic explorations). As such, *A Magazine Reader* focuses on the reader as an active participant – someone with agency rather than a passive consumer – in the process of creating fashion. Reading becomes making.

In this version of *A Magazine Reader* we disconnect the elements, break the joints, cut the seams, unravel body parts and disconnect garments from bodies, from backgrounds, objects, animals and gadgets, with the aim to create space to critically explore the construct of fashion. Out of which elements is today’s fashion made? What do these elements mean? What is left when you cut out the garment? When you have just arms, legs and a head of a model. There’s some jewelry. A necklace, some small rings. What happens when we erase the garment and the model all-together: the background surfaces; there’s a horse, a mountain and a small house. And don’t forget the text, the brand-names mentioned, the price. Paging through the magazine you bump into perfume, facial creams, rosemary water, travel suggestions, gadgets, books and so much more than just the garment.

It is through cutting the paper, highlighting, marking or erasing that we are able to lay bare these various elements that fashion is constructed of. By drawing them apart and seeing them as separates, we de-mystify. Although the cut has been described as a violent act it is also seen as one that is constructive. The same can be said about erasure which could be interpreted as a passive-aggressive act, but on the other hand, it also highlights the things that remain. In this workshop these acts can be seen as acts that question the violence and pervasiveness of mystification in fashion. In the fashion magazine, every possible element is used to create stories and myths of a future reality. These are commodified stories of hope, dreams and endless transformations into a better self. They are composed of so much more than garments alone, and in such a way that the joints and seams are smoothed out, turning these stories into a reality, a truth. By cutting through these dream worlds, drawing the various elements apart, erasing one and highlighting the other, we again become aware of the various elements in this system: we can see them as individual parts, rather than a homogenized bundle. We are able to recognize the various elements that the glossy smooth fashion dream is made of.

*A Magazine Reader* is an ongoing research trajectory and series of zines initiated by Femke de Vries and Hanka van der Voet. The series of workshops dissects and critically analyzes contemporary fashion magazines from various perspectives subsequently reproducing its content in an alternative form. By re-reading the magazine’s content, interrogating it and analysing its words, images, materiality, items and strategies, we change the ways in which we read fashion.

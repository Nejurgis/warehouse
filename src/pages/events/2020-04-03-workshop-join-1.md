      This *JOIN Collective Clothes* workshop at De Appel is part of a series of
      workshops by Anouk Beckers in which everyone is invited to make a piece of
      a garment.


      The base of *JOIN Collective Clothes* is a modular clothing system that
      consists of four different shapes which can be combined into a full outfit
      (a sleeve, a top, a trouser leg and a part of a skirt). At the end of the
      workshop, the results from the participants are joined into one complete
      outfit. The process of the workshop is playful, but at the same time it
      critically questions the characteristics of the fashion system exploring
      ownership, identity, (intellectual) property, production methods,
      alienation, mystification and value creation in fashion together.


      Initiator Anouk Beckers on *JOIN Collective Clothes*: “What if we open up
      the fashion system and explore it as a non-fixed entity, a system where
      people can playfully join in, where everyone is invited to create fashion
      together?”


      The fashion industry focuses mostly on designer status, brand identity,
      commodities as magical results of invisible processes and an adoration of
      values such as originality and ‘the new’. And although it is often
      perceived as something that is not for everyone, fashion surely is a
      collective practice. By making and wearing clothes together, the design
      and research project *JOIN Collective Clothes* proposes fashion as a
      collective practice. Besides joining one of the workshop, an easy-to-use
      open source can be downloaded at
      www.joincollectiveclothes.com/manual[](http://www.joincollectiveclothes.com/).
      The pieces made by various makers from all over the world form an
      ever-growing collection that can be seen on the *JOIN Collective Clothes*
      website.


      [JOIN Collective Clothes](https://www.joincollectiveclothes.com/) is an
      initiative by Anouk Beckers in collaboration with graphic designer and art
      director Beau Bertens.

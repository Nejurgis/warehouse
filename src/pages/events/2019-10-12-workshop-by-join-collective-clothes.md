During this launch of the *JOIN Collective Clothes Manual,* Anouk Beckers, Beau Bertens, Danielle Bruggeman and Eduardo Leon have a conversation about making clothes collectively, modularity and ownership in fashion. 

*JOIN Collective Clothes* is a design and research project which explores fashion as a collective practice, focusing on making and wearing clothes together. Everyone is invited to design and make a part of a garment – for example a sleeve – which together can be connected into full outfits. The pieces made by various makers form an ever-growing collection, questioning the working of the (fast) fashion industry. \
The launch of an open-source manual marks the start of the project, and is followed by a series of workshops and designer commissions. *JOIN Collective Clothes* is an initiative by fashion designer Anouk Beckers and graphic designer/art director Beau Bertens.

The base of *JOIN Collective Clothes* is a modular clothing system that consists of four different shapes which can be combined into a full outfit (a sleeve, a top, a trouser leg and a part of a skirt). An easy-to-use open source manual invites people to get started in designing and making the pieces themselves. This manual can be downloaded at www.joincollectiveclothes.com. On this website, all the results are collected to create an ever-growing collection of garment-pieces, designed by people all over the world. Initiator Anouk Beckers on *JOIN Collective Clothes*: “What if we open up the fashion system and explore it as a non-fixed entity, a system where people can playfully join in, where everyone is invited to create fashion together?”\
\
Although it is often perceived as something that is not for everyone, fashion is a collective practice. To grant everyone access *JOIN Collective Clothes* sets up a workshop tour. Everyone is invited to join one of the 4-hour workshops to design and make a garment-piece. At the end of the workshop, the results from the participants are joined into one full outfit. The process is playful, but at the same time it critically questions the characteristics of the fashion system. 

The fashion industry focuses mostly on designer status, brand identity, commodities as magical results of invisible processes and an adoration of values such as originality and ‘the new’. Therefore *JOIN Collective Clothes* explores subjects such as ownership, identity, (intellectual) property, production methods, alienation, mystification and value creation.\

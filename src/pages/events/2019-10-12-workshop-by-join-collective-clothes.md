During this launch of the JOIN Collective Clothes Manual, Anouk Beckers, Beau Bertens, Danielle Bruggeman and Eduardo Leon have a conversation about collective making, modularity and ownership in fashion. 

JOIN Collective Clothes is a design and research project which explores fashion as a collective practice, focusing on making and wearing clothes together. Everyone is invited to design and make a part of a garment – for example a sleeve – which together can be connected into full outfits. The pieces made by various makers form an ever-growing collection, questioning constructed values created by the (fast) fashion industry. \
The launch of an open-source manual marks the start of the project, and is followed by a series of workshops and designer commissions. JOIN Collective Clothes is an initiative by fashion designer Anouk Beckers and graphic designer/art director Beau Bertens.

The base of JOIN Collective Clothes is a modular clothing system that consists of four different shapes which can be combined into a full outfit (a sleeve, a top, a trouser leg and a part of a skirt). An easy-to-use open source manual invites people to get started in designing and making the pieces themselves. This manual can be downloaded at www.joincollectiveclothes.com. On this website, all the results are collected to create an ever-growing collection of garment-pieces, designed by people all over the world. Initiator Anouk Beckers on JOIN Collective Clothes: “What if we open up the fashion system and explore it as a non-fixed entity, a system where people can playfully join in, where everyone is invited to create fashion together?”

Fashion is a collective practice, although it is often perceived as something that is not for everyone. To grant everyone access, JOIN Collective Clothes will set up a workshop tour. Everyone is invited to join one of the 4-hour workshops to design and make a garment-piece. At the end of the workshop, the results from the participants are joined into one full outfit. The process is playful, but at the same time critically questions the characteristics of the fashion system. Subjects such as ownership, identity, (intellectual) property, production methods, alienation, mystification and value creation are discussed through this project.

The fashion industry focuses mostly on designer status, brand identity, commodities as magical results of invisible processes and an adoration of values such as originality and ‘the new’. JOIN Collective Clothes critically challenges this system by inviting design professionals to contribute parts of garments to the collective collection. \

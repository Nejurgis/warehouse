      During this launch of the *JOIN Collective Clothes Manual* at San Serriffe
      bookstore*,* Anouk Beckers, Beau Bertens, Danielle Bruggeman and Eduardo
      Leon will have a conversation about making clothes collectively,
      modularity and ownership/ego in fashion.


      The fashion industry focuses mostly on designer status, brand identity,
      commodities as magical results of invisible processes and an adoration of
      values such as originality and ‘the new’. And although it is often
      perceived as something that is not for everyone, fashion surely is a
      collective practice. By making and wearing clothes together, the design
      and research project *JOIN Collective Clothes* proposes fashion as a
      collective practice.

      Initiator Anouk Beckers on *JOIN Collective Clothes*: “What if we open up
      the fashion system and explore it as a non-fixed entity, a system where
      people can playfully join in, where everyone is invited to create fashion
      together?”


      The base of *JOIN Collective Clothes* is a modular clothing system that
      consists of four different shapes which can be combined into a full outfit
      (a sleeve, a top, a trouser leg and a part of a skirt). An easy-to-use
      open source manual invites people to get started in designing and making
      the pieces themselves. This manual can be downloaded at
      www.joincollectiveclothes.com and from the Warehouse webshop. The pieces
      made by various makers from all over the world form an ever-growing
      collection that can be seen on the *JOIN Collective Clothes* website.

      This launch of the open-source manual, designed by Beau Bertens, marks the
      start of the project and is followed by a series of workshops and designer
      commissions. Everyone is invited to join one of the 4-hour workshops to
      design and make a garment-piece. At the end of the workshop, the results
      from the participants are joined into one complete outfit. The process is
      playful, but at the same time it critically questions the characteristics
      of the fashion system exploring ownership, identity, (intellectual)
      property, production methods, alienation, mystification and value creation
      in fashion together.


      [JOIN Collective Clothes](https://www.joincollectiveclothes.com/) is an
      initiative by Anouk Beckers in collaboration with graphic designer and art
      director Beau Bertens.

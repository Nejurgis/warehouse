      In this *A Magazine Reader* workshop at Onomatopee we explore how every
      possible element; perfume, facial creams, rosemary water, travel
      suggestions, gadgets, books etcetera, is used to create stories and myths
      of a future reality. These 'stories' are composed of so much more than
      garments alone, and in such a way that the joints and seams are smoothed
      out, turning these stories into a reality, a truth.


      During this workshop, guided by Zuzana Kostelanská, Hanka van der Voet and
      Femke de Vries we disconnect the elements, break the joints, cut the
      seams, unravel body parts and disconnect garments from bodies, from
      backgrounds, objects, animals and gadgets, with the aim to create space to
      critically explore the construct of fashion. 


      *A Magazine Reader* revolves around the analysis of a mainstream and
      high-end fashion magazine and its translation into an alternative new zine
      to provide insight into the cultural power and forms of value production
      that is at the core of fashion media. In it, the reader becomes an active
      actor in the construct of fashion. Re-reading the magazine by dissecting
      it, analysing the words, images, materiality, the items shown on the pages
      and the strategies of the specific magazine changes the way we read
      fashion.


      In the workshop one specific magazine is selected. This magazine is
      thoroughly read, dissected and critically analysed on elements such as
      models, topicality, advertisements, material, brands, distribution,
      imagery, items, narrative, monetary value, colours, words and order of
      pages. By not starting from the perspective of the fashion system as a
      whole, but from the simple act of reading a fashion magazine, the reader
      gains an active role. Having the material in hands, seeing the images, how
      brands are being represented on the pages, reading the words and tracing
      the page numbers, but also feeling the paper, the weight and being able to
      smell the magazine creates an awareness of the magazine as a material
      object. Something that embodies and communicates the process of value
      production in fashion. A material representation of fashion’s
      ephemerality, dream worlds and fantasies.


      The readers in the workshop use the material of the original ‘source
      magazine’ to create a new zine that provides insight into the cultural
      power and forms of value production that is at the core of fashion media.
      The existing material is elaborated on by connecting with other material
      (theories, visuals, artistic explorations). As such, *A Magazine Reader*
      focuses on the reader as an active participant – someone with agency
      rather than a passive consumer – in the process of creating fashion.
      Reading becomes making.


      *A Magazine Reader* is an ongoing research trajectory and series of zines
      initiated by Femke de Vries and Hanka van der Voet.

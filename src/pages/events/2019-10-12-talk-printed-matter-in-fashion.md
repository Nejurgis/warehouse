      Warehouse will participate in Printing Plant Art Book Fair with a
      selection of independent fashion publications. Also, Beau Bertens, Elisa
      van Joolen, Femke de Vries, Jan Schoon and Mary-Lou Berkulin will have a
      conversation about independent fashion publishing.


      As Warehouse aims to create an engaging environment that facilitates
      dialogue and an alternative fashion discourse that goes beyond seeing
      fashion as a commodity Warehouse supported and produced a number of
      projects that explore with a critical eye, the trademarks of fashion. Some
      of these projects are *PORTAL*, *Press & Fold*, *A Magazine Reader* and
      *Monument*. During their talk at Printing Plant, Femke de Vries and Elisa
      van Joolen, along with Jan Schoon, Mary-Lou Berkulin (*Monument*) and Beau
      Bertens (*Press & Fold*), share insights on how they dissect fashion
      magazines, make fashion publications, approach the garment as carrier and
      medium and redefine the role of the wearer and the maker.\

      \

      For this year's fair we've selected independent fashion publications by
      the following makers: Chet Bugter, Rosita Kaer, Stijn Pomm√©e and Zoe
      Philine.

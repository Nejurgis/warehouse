During this launch at Walter Books, Femke de Vries, Line Arngaard & Sonia Oet (*A March Issue*) and students from MA Fashion Strategy generation 27 discussed the representation and meaning of luxury in the fashion magazine.

A Magazine Reader is a workshop in which the act of ‘reading a magazine’ is used as an approach to critically explore fashion magazines. During the workshop, a fashion magazine is critically analysed from various perspectives and subsequently put together again in an alternative form.

In the workshop we select one specific magazine. This magazine is thoroughly read, dissected and critically analysed on elements such as models, topicality, advertisements, material, brands, distribution, imagery, items, narrative, monetary value, colours, words and order of pages. By not starting from the perspective of the fashion system at large, but from the simple act of reading a fashion magazine, the reader gains an active role. Having the material in hands, seeing the images, how brands are being represented on the pages, reading the words and tracing the page numbers, but also feeling the paper, the weight and being able to smell the magazine creates an awareness of the magazine as a material object. Something that embodies and communicates the process of value production in fashion. A material representation of fashion’s ephemerality, dream worlds and fantasies.

The readers in the workshop use the material of the original ‘source magazine’ to create a new zine that provides insight into the cultural power and forms of value production that is at the core of fashion media. The existing material is elaborated on by connecting with other material (theories, visuals, artistic explorations). As such, A Magazine Reader focuses on the reader as an active participant – someone with agency rather than a passive consumer – in the process of creating fashion. We approach reading as making.

Femke de Vries and Hanka van der Voet started this workshop from sharing their many critical thoughts on fashion media; how it is intertwined with the industry and is lacking critical reflection, and as such, is solely approaching fashion as a commodity. So, we decided to develop a workshop format that critically explores fashion magazines and reconfigures key characteristics of the fashion magazine into a proposition for a new fashion magazine.

The first edition of A Magazine Reader is *V*GUE*. In this five-day workshop which was held in February 2018 with first year MA Fashion Strategy students of generation #27 at ArtEZ University of the Arts we explored a British Vogue from the perspective of luxury today, and the way luxury is being sold through fashion mass media. We chose British Vogue as our source material because of its renowned status within the fashion world and the excessiveness and extravagant use of glossy words and visuals adhering to the idea that fashion purely exists as a commodity. A Magazine Reader 01 is designed in collaboration with Corine van der Wal. The content is developed by ArtEZ Fashion Strategy students of gen #27 Adriana Fox Hopper, Chinouk Filique de Miranda, Cinzia Magnani, Hester Brands, Ieva Uzkurataite, Julia Kaleta, Karmen Samson, Maria Gil Mendoza, and Marina Sasseron de Oliveira Cabral.

Many thanks to ArtEZ Fashion Strategy, Chet Bugter, Corine van der Wal, Elisa van Joolen and Walter Books for hosting, facilitating and creating A Magazine Reader.

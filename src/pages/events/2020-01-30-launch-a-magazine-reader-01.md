During this launch Femke de Vries, Line Arngaard & Sonia Oet (*A March Issue*) and students from MA Fashion Strategy generation 27 discuss the representation and meaning of luxury in the fashion magazine.

*A Magazine Reader* revolves around the analysis of a mainstream and high-end fashion magazine and its translation into an alternative new zine to provide insight into the cultural power and forms of value production that is at the core of fashion media. In it, the reader becomes an active actor in the construct of fashion. Re-reading the magazine by dissecting it, analysing the words, images, materiality, the items shown on the pages and the strategies of the specific magazine changes the way we read fashion.

In the workshop we select one specific magazine. This magazine is thoroughly read, dissected and critically analysed on elements such as models, topicality, advertisements, material, brands, distribution, imagery, items, narrative, monetary value, colours, words and order of pages. By not starting from the perspective of the fashion system at large, but from the simple act of reading a fashion magazine, the reader gains an active role. Having the material in hands, seeing the images, how brands are being represented on the pages, reading the words and tracing the page numbers, but also feeling the paper, the weight and being able to smell the magazine creates an awareness of the magazine as a material object. Something that embodies and communicates the process of value production in fashion. A material representation of fashion’s ephemerality, dream worlds and fantasies.

The readers in the workshop use the material of the original ‘source magazine’ to create a new zine that provides insight into the cultural power and forms of value production that is at the core of fashion media. The existing material is elaborated on by connecting with other material (theories, visuals, artistic explorations). As such, *A Magazine Reader* focuses on the reader as an active participant – someone with agency rather than a passive consumer – in the process of creating fashion. We approach reading as making.

This first edition of *A Magazine Reader* is titled *V*GUE.* In this workshop with first year MA Fashion Strategy students of generation 27 at ArtEZ University of the Arts, we explored a *British Vogue* from the perspective of luxury today, and the way luxury is being sold through fashion mass media.

A conversation with Brad Haylock, Laura Gardner and Ricarda Bigolin on the book All or Nothing. This launch at San Serriffe included a performative show of a series of book-carrying-garments and a duo-reading with Chet Bugter and Ricarda Bigolin.

Warehouse has invited Melbourne fashion designer and researcher Ricarda Bigolin to Amsterdam for the launch of the *D&K LOOK BOOK 2019*. D&K explores the potential of fashion practice as a site of critical questioning and ubiquitous revelations. The project was co-founded in 2012 by fashion designer and researcher Ricarda Bigolin and curator Nella Themelios (2012–2017) and includes a wide array of collaborators including fashion designer and lecturer Chantal Kirby as core collaborator from 2019. The publication questions the ubiquity and mass consumption of fashion (images), and their relationships to the products depicted and how fashion produces and circulates collections of images.

The *D&K LOOK BOOK 2019*, designed by Brad Haylock and published by Surpllus will be co-launched with *Mode and Mode* issue seven, by Laura Gardner and Karina Soraya, which serves as an anthology of text works and biographical listings of key D&K projects from 2012 to present. Continuing the mission of *Mode and Mode* in exploring experimental publishing practices at the margins of fashion, this issue shares, in chronological order, a body of experimental text works by a critical fashion practice. As intrinsic to their exhibition and garment-based work, D&K produce writing—including ficto-critical prose, cut-and-paste collage, poetry, and screenwriting—to reconstitute components of fashion, such as the garment, atmospheric conditions of retail space and packaging ephemera. Their interrogation of fashion language in (and as) branding highlights the plasticity of words, which are always both meaningless and meaningful.

The co-launch of *D&K LOOK BOOK 2019* coincides with a limited-edition series of publication ‘covers’ created by D&K (Ricarda Bigolin & Chantal Kirby) and a performance at San Serriffe. Dressing a crew of stand-in models at the launch, the collection re-fashions lurid, synthetic, reclaimed pre-fab curtains, as covers with pockets that hold the D&K look books. These ‘looks’ are fashioned around garments and the publication itself, smuggling the publications to the launch event on stand-in models tasked with carrying the publications.

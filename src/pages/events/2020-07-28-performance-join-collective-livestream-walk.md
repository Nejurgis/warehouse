      On Monday 6 July 2020 the JOIN Collective Livestream Walk in Amsterdam's
      main shopping street the Kalverstraat took place. This livestream walk
      showed the results of the JOIN Collective Clothes workshop, using the JOIN
      open source manual. This manual made, and still makes, it possible for
      everyone to design and make a piece of a garment within this modular
      clothing system. Within a year more than 120 different garment-pieces were
      made. This collective collection was the effort of various makers:
      workshop participants, designers and friends of JOIN. 


      Stylist Pieter Eliens composed the pieces into a variety of garments that
      were presented by 30 people. The choreography was developed in
      collaboration with[](https://www.instagram.com/luncatics.and.poets/)
      Lunatics and Poets. 


      Watch the entire show via the [JOIN
      IGTV](https://www.instagram.com/tv/CCTvHQXFenB/).

\
The *JOIN Collective Conversation Magazine* is the result of a *JOIN Collective Clothes* workshop at MA Fashion Strategy (ArtEZ Fashion Masters). During this workshop the students of generation #29  together explored topics such as ownership, identity, (intellectual) property, production methods, alienation, mystification and value creation and used the *JOIN Collective Clothes* manual to make a garment piece. At the end of the workshop the pieces were put together, photographed, reflected upon through text and brought together in this magazine.

      *A Magazine Reader 01* is the result of a workshop by Femke de Vries and
      Hanka van der Voet in which the students of the MA Fashion Strategy
      generation 27 explore the representation and meaning of luxury in the
      fashion magazine. In this case specifically the *British Vogue*, February
      2018.


      *A Magazine Reader* is an ongoing research trajectory and series of zines
      initiated by Femke de Vries and Hanka van der Voet. It revolves around the
      analysis of a mainstream and high-end fashion magazine and its translation
      into an alternative new zine to provide insight into the cultural power
      and forms of value production that is at the core of fashion media. In it,
      the reader becomes an active actor in the construct of fashion. Re-reading
      the magazine by dissecting it, analysing the words, images, materiality,
      the items shown on the pages and the strategies of the specific magazine
      changes the way we read fashion.


      In the workshop one specific magazine is selected. This magazine is
      thoroughly read, dissected and critically analysed on elements such as
      models, topicality, advertisements, material, brands, distribution,
      imagery, items, narrative, monetary value, colours, words and order of
      pages. By not starting from the perspective of the fashion system as a
      whole, but from the simple act of reading a fashion magazine, the reader
      gains an active role. Having the material in hands, seeing the images, how
      brands are being represented on the pages, reading the words and tracing
      the page numbers, but also feeling the paper, the weight and being able to
      smell the magazine creates an awareness of the magazine as a material
      object. Something that embodies and communicates the process of value
      production in fashion. A material representation of fashion’s
      ephemerality, dream worlds and fantasies.


      The readers in the workshop use the material of the original ‘source
      magazine’ to create a new zine that provides insight into the cultural
      power and forms of value production that is at the core of fashion media.
      The existing material is elaborated on by connecting with other material
      (theories, visuals, artistic explorations). As such, *A Magazine Reader*
      focuses on the reader as an active participant – someone with agency
      rather than a passive consumer – in the process of creating fashion.
      Reading becomes making.

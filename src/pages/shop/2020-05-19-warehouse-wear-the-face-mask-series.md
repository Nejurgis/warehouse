      For Warehouse Wear | The Face Mask Series, we have invited five critical
      fashion practitioners from various corners of the world to share their
      propositions for a - for many of us - new character in our wardrobes: the
      face mask. The participants are FEMAIL (United States), HAiKw/ (Norway),
      Lucia Cuba (Peru), Sho Konishi (Japan) and Schueller de Waal (The
      Netherlands). The Covid-19 circumstances require that many of us start
      wearing face masks in public life from now on. They are becoming an
      integrated part of our daily lives and our appearance in public space.
      Besides that, the face mask is a garment that brings forward mixed
      responses; it reminds us of infectious diseases and danger but it can also
      be seen as an act of solidarity towards others.


      First up, US-based design duo FEMAIL continue their collaborative
      postal-based-practice by creating a fun *foot2face* solution that revolves
      around human connection and includes a pair of socks and stockings.

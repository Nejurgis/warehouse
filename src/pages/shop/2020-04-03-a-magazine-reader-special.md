In *A Magazine Reader Invites 01*, Zuzana Kostelansk치 folds a complete fashion magazine into a new object. The fold shifts our perspective, cuts pages in half and re-arranges the order of the pages changing our way of reading. In *A Magazine Reader Invites* an artist/thinker/designer is invited to re-read a fashion magazine. Every edition includes a conversation with the maker about the approach of re-reading the magazine.

*A Magazine Reader Invites* is part of the *A Magazine Reader* series which revolves around the analysis of a mainstream and high-end fashion magazine and its translation into an alternative new zine to provide insight into the cultural power and forms of value production that is at the core of fashion media. In it, the reader becomes an active actor in the construct of fashion. Re-reading the magazine by dissecting it, analysing the words, images, materiality, the items shown on the pages and the strategies of the specific magazine changes the way we read fashion.\

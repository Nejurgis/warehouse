      For Warehouse Wear | The Face Mask Series, we have invited five critical
      fashion practitioners from various corners of the world to share their
      propositions for a - for many of us - new character in our wardrobes: the
      face mask. The participants are FEMAIL (United States), HAiKw/ (Norway),
      Lucia Cuba (Peru), Sho Konishi (Japan) and Schueller de Waal (The
      Netherlands). The Covid-19 circumstances require that many of us start
      wearing face masks in public life from now on. They are becoming an
      integrated part of our daily lives and our appearance in public space.
      Besides that, the face mask is a garment that brings forward mixed
      responses; it reminds us of infectious diseases and danger but it can also
      be seen as an act of solidarity towards others.


      The next contribution to Warehouse Wear | The Face Mask Series comes from
      Japanese fashion designer Sho Konishi. In his practice, he often works
      with different forms of facial coverage. In the video tutorial, he uses a
      simple pattern and shows step-by-step how to create his version of a face
      mask that includes decorative threads and straps.


      The items of the Warehouse Wear Face Mask Series will not be sold, but
      will be released through do-it-yourself video- and .pdf tutorials -
      inviting everyone to start getting acquainted with the face mask and make
      one themselves. You can find the video tutorial over on our
      [IGTV-channel](https://www.instagram.com/amsterdam.warehouse/channel/),
      and the .pdf-tutorial as a free download below.

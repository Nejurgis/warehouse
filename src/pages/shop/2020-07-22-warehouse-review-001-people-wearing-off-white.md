      *Warehouse Review* is a publication that aims to explore alternative modes
      of fashion criticism. The series intends to fill gaps left by the fashion
      industry when it comes to fashion critique. *Warehouse Review* strives to
      give a thorough analysis and contextualisation of various contemporary
      fashion phenomena. The inaugural issue of *Warehouse Review*, titled
      ‘People Wearing Off-White’, is dedicated to Virgil Abloh’s highly visible
      and recognizable luxury streetwear brand Off-White.


      The project started as the documentation of a personal fascination with
      the overwhelming presence of a yellow industrial belt and a logo with
      crossed arrows on the streets of Amsterdam. What was it, and where did it
      originate from? And why was it so popular? At the end of the summer of
      2019, Warehouse co-founder Hanka van der Voet started documenting people
      wearing Off-White she encountered in the streets. The results were
      collected through her Instagram stories. Using the hashtag
      #peoplewearingoffwhite, Hanka asked her followers to contribute images as
      well. In five months time, a collection of over 200 images of people
      wearing Off-White was established. Starting off as an obsession with
      collecting the images, this project quickly turned into a fascination with
      Off-White designer Virgil Abloh, the immense popularity of his brand, and
      the lack of contextualisation the mainstream fashion media was providing
      for this phenomenon.


      ‘People Wearing Off-White’ offers a fresh critique on Virgil Abloh’s
      presence in the fashion and art world. It dissects the hype by addressing
      the specific brand language, analysing Off-White’s Instagram presence and
      providing a new perspective on one of Off-White’s most popular product:
      the yellow industrial belt. The publication also presents an analytical
      essay and overview of the #peoplewearingoffwhite photo collection. How did
      this brand come into being, in what context can it exist and what tactics
      are used to build this specific brand image? Designed by Line Arngaard,
      the zine features contributions by Chinouk Filique de Miranda, Denise
      Bernts, Femke de Vries and Hanka van der Voet.

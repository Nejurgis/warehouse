*PORTAL 001is the result of a PORTAL edition that took place during…..*The information that was collected during PORTAL…… is brought together into a reader PORTAL …… that explores what this collection of data uncovers.*\
PORTAL*offers a ‘way in’ to understanding garments from a multitude of overlapping and intersecting perspectives.\
For every edition participants are asked to take off a garment, lay it down on a large Tyvek sheet, tape its outline and answer a series of questions. These questions revolve around the garment’s production (Where was it made?), its materials (What is it made of?), ownership (Is it yours?) and value (How much did it cost? What is the emotional value?). It connects locations (all items that are made in China are connected with pink tape) and temporalities (all items that were purchased in 2018 are connected with brown tape) that are not usually part of how fashion presents itself.\
*PORTAL*thusdepicts the complex and layered system that is the reality of the clothing we wear. Itinverts our gaze, shining a spotlight on the intricacies of our own outfits and extraordinary aspects of the everyday as opposed to the myth of the exclusive fashion image.

With the acknowledgement that clothing has meaning and value beyond economic terms the potential for a new kind of fashion narrative opens up. This is a narrative that has a different relationship to value. As suggested in*Facing Value: Radical Perspectives from the Arts*: “Reformulating value as a constituting factor in an open and caring society requires a ‘tilting vision’.”*PORTAL*provides an entryway to such a vision, one that begins to prioritise values that are ephemeral and yet integral in “influencing hearts and minds and shaping the way we live together”.\

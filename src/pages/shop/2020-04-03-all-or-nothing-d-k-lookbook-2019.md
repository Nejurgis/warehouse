      D&K explores the potential of fashion practice as a site of critical
      questioning and ubiquitous revelations. The project was co-founded in 2012
      by fashion designer and researcher Ricarda Bigolin and curator Nella
      Themelios (2012–2017) and includes a wide array of collaborators. The *D&K
      LOOK BOOK 2019* questions the ubiquity and mass consumption of fashion
      (images), and their relationships to the products depicted and how fashion
      produces and circulates collections of images.


      The *D&K LOOK BOOK 2019*, designed by Brad Haylock and published by
      Surpllus was co-launched with *Mode and Mode* issue seven, by Laura
      Gardner and Karina Soraya, which serves as an anthology of text works and
      biographical listings of key D&K projects from 2012 to present. Warehouse
      is happy to have hosted the Dutch launch of both publications.

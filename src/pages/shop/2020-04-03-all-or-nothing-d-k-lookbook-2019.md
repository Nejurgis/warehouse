      D&K explores the potential of fashion practice as a site of critical
      questioning and ubiquitous revelations. The project was co-founded in 2012
      by fashion designer and researcher Ricarda Bigolin and curator Nella
      Themelios (2012–2017) and includes a wide array of collaborators. The
      publication questions the ubiquity and mass consumption of fashion
      (images), and their relationships to the products depicted and how fashion
      produces and circulates collections of images.


      The *D&K LOOK BOOK 2019*, designed by Brad Haylock and published by
      Surpllus was co-launched with *Mode and Mode* issue seven, by Laura
      Gardner and Karina Soraya, which serves as an anthology of text works and
      biographical listings of key D&K projects from 2012 to present. Warehouse
      is happy to have hosted the Dutch launch of both publications.

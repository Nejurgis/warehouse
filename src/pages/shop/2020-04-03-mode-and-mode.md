*Mode and Mode* is a periodical that addresses printed matter in fashion practice by Laura Gardner and Karina Soraya.\
Continuing the mission of *Mode and Mode* in exploring experimental publishing practices at the margins of fashion, this issue shares, in chronological order, a body of experimental text works by the critical fashion practice of D&K. Accompanying the D&K *Look Book 2019 - All or Nothing, Mode and Mode 7 serves as* an anthology of text works and biographical listings of key D&K projects from 2012 to present. \
As intrinsic to their exhibition and garment-based work, D&K produce writing—including ficto-critical prose, cut-and-paste collage, poetry, and screenwriting—to reconstitute components of fashion, such as the garment, atmospheric conditions of retail space and packaging ephemera. Their interrogation of fashion language in (and as) branding highlights the plasticity of words, which are always both meaningless and meaningful.\
\
*Mode and Mode 7* was co-launched with the *D&K LOOK BOOK 2019* at San Serriffe. Warehouse is happy to have hosted the Dutch launch of both publications.\

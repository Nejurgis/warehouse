      *Press & Fold* is an independent fashion magazine that explores
      alternative fashion forms and narratives. The magazine provides a platform
      for critical fashion practitioners who actively seek out the cracks and
      fissures in the current fashion system to propose new opportunities for
      making and doing fashion. More than 20 contributors – ranging from visual
      artists and writers to fashion designers and researchers – present their
      view on this issue’s theme: luxury.


      From luxury characterised as uniqueness created by lowly and anonymous
      artisans in pre-democratic times, to made-to-measure haute couture and the
      cult of the star designer at the end of the 19th century, from the merging
      of mass market and prestige into ‘masstige’ (a term coined by Karl
      Lagerfeld, introducing his H&M collaboration in 2004) to the hunger for
      street credibility by luxury fashion houses causing them to sell 2000 euro
      hoodies, and from the conspicuous consumption showcased on Instagram to
      the explosion of wellness and self-care culture; luxury has had many faces
      over the past few decades.


      Among a new generation of fashion designers, researchers, writers and
      curators, very different views on luxury, and fashion in general, exist.
      Motivated by the sorry state of the current fashion system and its
      exploitative labour practices, environmental pollution, depletion of
      resources and exclusionary marketing language among other things, this
      generation is not only critiquing the system, its individualistic approach
      and its limiting views on the concept of luxury (among other things), but
      also seeking to create alternative, more inclusive ways of defining
      luxury. In this issue of *Press & Fold*, we give voice to these new ideas
      and propositions on contemporary luxury and its material and immaterial
      characteristics.


      These new imaginations on luxury show a radical departure from the
      classical interpretation of the concept; a concept that is firmly rooted
      in the idea that luxury is above all about abundance and indulgence, and
      therefore is not absolutely necessary, but a privilege for the happy few.
      But what actually is a ‘necessity’ in contemporary society, and what do we
      define as ‘abundance’? In the context of late capitalism and its
      inequities and growing political polarization, the ideas on what luxury
      constitutes are rapidly shifting. Self-care is making way for a collective
      form of care: for creating together, performing together, learning
      together, regaining agency together.

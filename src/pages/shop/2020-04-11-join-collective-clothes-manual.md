      The *JOIN Collective Clothes Manual* is an open-source manual that invites
      everyone to participate in JOIN, a project by fashion designer Anouk
      Beckers and graphic designer and art director Beau Bertens, that proposes
      fashion as a collective practice. The manual encompasses the patterns of a
      modular clothing system that consists of four different shapes which can
      be combined into a full outfit (a sleeve, a top, a trouser leg and a part
      of a skirt). As it is easy-to-use everyone can make the pieces themselves.
      This manual can also be downloaded at www.joincollectiveclothes.com.


      The pieces made by various makers from all over the world, subsequently
      form an ever-growing collection that can be seen on the *JOIN Collective
      Clothes* website. 


      The fashion industry focuses mostly on designer status, brand identity,
      commodities as magical results of invisible processes and an adoration of
      values such as originality and ‘the new’. And although it is often
      perceived as something that is not for everyone, fashion surely is a
      collective practice. By making and wearing clothes together, the design
      and research project *JOIN Collective Clothes* proposes fashion as a
      collective practice.


      Beside participating by downloading or buying the manual the project
      consists of a series of workshops and designer commissions. Everyone is
      invited to join one of the 4-hour workshops to design and make a
      garment-piece. At the end of the workshop, the results from the
      participants are joined into one complete outfit. The process is playful,
      but at the same time it critically questions the characteristics of the
      fashion system exploring ownership, identity, (intellectual) property,
      production methods, alienation, mystification and value creation in
      fashion together.


      Initiator Anouk Beckers on *JOIN Collective Clothes*: “What if we open up
      the fashion system and explore it as a non-fixed entity, a system where
      people can playfully join in, where everyone is invited to create fashion
      together?”

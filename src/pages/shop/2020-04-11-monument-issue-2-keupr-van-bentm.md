      *Monument* is a fanzine dedicated to the 'Dutch Wave', a group of Dutch
      fashion designers who created international fame around the turn of the
      century. Each number is dedicated to one designer or design duo. This
      second issue focuses on the work of the duo Keupr/van Bentm (Michiel
      Keuper and Francisco van Benthum). Between 1997 and 2001, they challenged
      the fashion industry with their surprising and colorful statement
      collections.


      In *Monument*, a project by stylist and fashion researcher Mary-Lou
      Berkulin and graphic designer Karen van der Kraats, images and texts from
      various archives are combined with new interviews and photography. Each
      issue has its own unique design and editorial approach, completely in
      keeping with the designer to whom the issue is dedicated. Central to this
      paper monument for Keupr/van Bentm is the work that they made between 1997
      and 2001. A conversation between Mary-Lou Berkulin and Keupr/van Bentm has
      been supplemented with quotes and texts from articles from the archive and
      a new long-read, written by fashion researcher Laura Gardner. The items
      from the archive have been photographed by Roos Quakernaat.

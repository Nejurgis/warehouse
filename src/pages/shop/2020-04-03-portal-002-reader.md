      PORTAL 002 Reader is the result of a workshop during the *State of
      Fashion* in Arnhem in which the economic, social and emotional value of
      clothing worn by visitors of the exhibition, is collected and researched.
      The collected data is visualized and brought together in a reader designed
      by Beau Bertens.


      *PORTAL* is a research project that explores the economic, social and
      emotional value of clothingand offers a ‘way in’ to understanding garments
      from a multitude of overlapping and intersecting perspectives.


      For every edition, participants are asked to take off a garment, lay it
      down on a large Tyvek sheet, outline their garment with tape and answer a
      series of questions regarding its production (Where was it made?),
      materials (What is it made of?), ownership (Is it yours?) and value (How
      much did it cost? What is the emotional value?). Subsequently connections
      are made between the garments by literally drawing lines between the items
      of the various visitors, creating a network that reveals connections
      between and intersections of personal, economic, social, cultural and
      political realms surfacing a complex and layered system of the reality of
      clothing.This culminates in a map, or landscape of personal stories that
      connect to form a fashion network whichinverts our gaze, shining a
      spotlight on the intricacies of our own outfits and extraordinary aspects
      of the everyday as opposed to the myth of the exclusive fashion image.
      *PORTAL* thus provides an entryway to a vision that begins to prioritise
      values that are ephemeral and yet integral in “influencing hearts and
      minds and shaping the way we live together”. It captures and visualises
      information that circumvents established hierarchies and disrupts the
      homogeneity of the commercially driven fashion system with the refreshing
      diversity of fashion that is worn; embodied and imperfect.


      The collected information of each *PORTAL* edition is visualized and
      brought together in a reader using the sixteen *PORTAL* questions as their
      starting point.


      For *PORTAL 002* Elisa van Joolen worked with visitors of State of Fashion
      in Arnhem. The pages of the *PORTAL 002* reader, designed by Beau Bertens,
      show the surprising details that emerge from the collective document of
      *State of Fashion* in Arnhem. 41% of all garments and accessories are
      gifts. Do we treasure or wear more often those garments that have been
      gifted? What does it mean to ‘half’ own a garment, share it rather than
      own it or borrow it? How do these shifting relationships to ownership
      change our interactions with a garment and perhaps more importantly how
      are our interactions and relationships with other people influenced
      through the modes of transaction and exchange that are enabled by this?

      *PORTAL 004* | Exercise and coloring book for children is the result of
      *PORTAL 004*,  a workshop in which children from the public primary school
      OBS Twiske, under the supervision of students of the MA Fashion Strategy,
      investigated the different values of clothing. In this book, which is
      based on the questions and outcomes of this workshop, children can
      actively learn more about their clothing and the different values attached
      to it. In this way they become more aware of how to deal with the value of
      clothing.


      *PORTAL* is a research project that explores the economic, social and
      emotional value of clothing and offers a ‘way in’ to understanding
      garments from a multitude of overlapping and intersecting perspectives.


      For every edition, participants are asked to take off a garment, lay it
      down on a large Tyvek sheet, outline their garment with tape and answer a
      series of questions regarding its production (Where was it made?),
      materials (What is it made of?), ownership (Is it yours?) and value (How
      much did it cost? What is the emotional value?). Subsequently connections
      are made between the garments by literally drawing lines between the items
      of the various visitors, creating a network that reveals connections
      between and intersections of personal, economic, social, cultural and
      political realms surfacing a complex and layered system of the reality of
      clothing.This culminates in a map, or landscape of personal stories that
      connect to form a fashion network which inverts our gaze, shining a
      spotlight on the intricacies of our own outfits and extraordinary aspects
      of the everyday as opposed to the myth of the exclusive fashion image.
      *PORTAL* thus provides an entryway to a vision that begins to prioritise
      values that are ephemeral and yet integral in “influencing hearts and
      minds and shaping the way we live together”. Itcaptures and visualises
      information that circumvents established hierarchies and disrupts the
      homogeneity of the commercially driven fashion system with the refreshing
      diversity of fashion that is worn; embodied and imperfect.


      The collected information of each *PORTAL* edition is visualized and
      brought together in a reader using the sixteen *PORTAL* questions as their
      starting point.

A Magazine Reader 03 is a result of two days workshop by Femke de Vries, Hanka van der Voet and me, hosted by Onomatopee in Eindhoven. With several participants we read the October issue of Harperâ€™s Bazaar with a pair of scissors in our hands. Reading became cutting, marking and rearranging the content into new narratives. Tamar Shafrir writes how combining is even more essential to the creation of collage than cutting, as it is a process of rewriting. By doing so we become aware of the many elements that are used to construct fashion, and, above all, that clothes are just one of the many carriers of fashion.

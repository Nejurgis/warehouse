      *PORTAL 001* Reader is the result of a workshop during the *Change the
      System* exhibition at Museum Boijmans van Beuningen in Rotterdam in which
      Elisa van Joolen worked with MA Fashion Strategy students generation 27 to
      research the economic, social and emotional value of clothing worn by
      visitors of the exhibition. The collected information on 159 pieces of
      clothing is visualized and brought together in this reader designed by
      Beau Bertens.


      *PORTAL* is a research project that explores the economic, social and
      emotional value of clothing and offers a ‘way in’ to understanding
      garments from a multitude of overlapping and intersecting perspectives.


      For every edition, participants are asked to take off a garment, lay it
      down on a large Tyvek sheet, outline their garment with tape and answer a
      series of questions regarding its production (Where was it made?),
      materials (What is it made of?), ownership (Is it yours?) and value (How
      much did it cost? What is the emotional value?). Subsequently connections
      are made between the garments by literally drawing lines between the items
      of the various visitors, creating a network that reveals connections
      between and intersections of personal, economic, social, cultural and
      political realms surfacing a complex and layered system of the reality of
      clothing. This culminates in a map, or landscape of personal stories that
      connect to form a fashion network which inverts our gaze, shining a
      spotlight on the intricacies of our own outfits and extraordinary aspects
      of the everyday as opposed to the myth of the exclusive fashion image.
      *PORTAL* thus provides an entryway to a vision that begins to prioritise
      values that are ephemeral and yet integral in “influencing hearts and
      minds and shaping the way we live together”. It captures and visualises
      information that circumvents established hierarchies and disrupts the
      homogeneity of the commercially driven fashion system with the refreshing
      diversity of fashion that is worn; embodied and imperfect.


      The collected information of each *PORTAL* edition is visualized and
      brought together in a reader using the sixteen *PORTAL* questions as their
      starting point.


      For *PORTAL 001* Elisa van Joolen worked with students from the MA Fashion
      Strategy programme of ArtEZ University of the Arts to research the
      economic, social and emotional value of clothing worn by visitors of the
      *Change the System* exhibition at Museum Boijmans van Beuningen in
      Rotterdam. Information on 159 pieces of clothing worn by visitors was
      collected. The collected data is visualized and brought together in a
      reader designed by Beau Bertens.
